Verify that the filtering mechanism returns institutions meeting all criteria, serving as a base dataset for subsequent cross-endpoint validation.  \n    - **Expected Response:** A non-empty list of institutions where each institution matches the specified filters (e.g., state = \"CA\", charterType = \"National Bank\") and has valid attributes like institutionID and name.\n\n2. **Title:** Confirm Location Details Corresponding to Filtered Institutions  \n    - **API Endpoint:** GET /locations  \n    - **Description:** Using institution IDs obtained from step 1, fetch all locations for these institutions. This step checks that locations returned are correctly linked to the filtered institutions only and match the requested institutions\u2019 geographic constraints.  \n    - **Expected Response:** Lists of location entries with valid institutionID references corresponding exactly to those from step 1, and proper location details (address, city, state). No locations should be linked to institutions outside the filtered criteria.\n\n3. **Title:** Retrieve Financials for Institutions and Verify Data Completeness and Accuracy  \n    - **API Endpoint:** GET /financials  \n    - **Description:** For the same institution IDs from step 1, retrieve the current financial data, including assets, liabilities, and capital amounts. This step tests consistency between institution metadata and their financial metrics, especially checking for completeness and reasonable value ranges.  \n    - **Expected Response:** Financial records matching institution IDs from step 1. Each financial record should include up-to-date, plausible numeric values. Missing or inconsistent financial records should be flagged as errors.\n\n4. **Title:** Fetch Historical Structural Changes and Ensure Alignment With Institutions\u2019 Status  \n    - **API Endpoint:** GET /history  \n    - **Description:** Query structural change events for the institutions obtained earlier. This step verifies whether history events such as mergers, renames, or charter changes are properly linked and reflect current institution statuses obtained in prior steps. Inconsistencies here could indicate stale or mismatched history data.  \n    - **Expected Response:** Historical events linked solely to institution IDs from step 1. Events should be chronologically valid and consistent with institutions\u2019 current attributes, and none should reference institutions outside the filter scope.\n\n5. **Title:** Investigate Failure Records to Confirm No Contradictions With Active Institutions  \n    - **API Endpoint:** GET /failures  \n    - **Description:** Query any failure records related to the institution IDs filtered in step 1. This tests for logical contradictions (e.g., an institution marked active but also listed in failures). It also ensures the failure data system integrates correctly without contaminating the dataset of active banks.  \n    - **Expected Response:** Ideally, no failure records for active institutions returned in step 1. If failure records exist, they must logically exclude active status or be part of institution history (e.g., predecessor institutions), otherwise, inconsistencies are indicated.\n\n6. **Title:** Cross-Validate Aggregated Financial Summaries Against Individual Institution Data  \n    - **API Endpoint:** GET /summary  \n    - **Description:** Retrieve historical aggregate data (e.g., yearly assets totals) relevant to the filtered institutions\u2019 geographic region or charter type. This step verifies if the aggregation summaries are consistent with the sum of individual financial figures obtained previously. Discrepancies could reveal aggregation bugs or incorrect filters in summary generation.  \n    - **Expected Response:** Yearly aggregate summaries covering the time span related to filtered institution data. Aggregate totals should equal the sum of individual financials from step 3 when filtered equivalently, within acceptable rounding margins.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis scenario extensively tests the system\u2019s filtering and data integration capabilities focused on a specific subset of active financial institutions defined by geographic and charter type filters. It checks for consistent linkage across institution metadata, location data, financial performance, structural changes, failure records, and aggregate summaries. The workflow is designed to uncover defects related to data filtering, mismatches between related datasets, incorrect historical linkage, improper inclusion of failed institutions in active datasets, and aggregation logic errors. Such comprehensive interaction coverage ensures robustness and reliability of the financial institutions\u2019 REST API system.", "usage": {"total_tokens": 75322, "total_cost": 0.034210000000000004}, "unique_endpoints": {"200": ["GET /institutions"], "300": [], "400": [], "500": 0}, "total_true_result": 0, "total_false_result": 3}
