This tests correct spatial nesting handling, tag filtering, and grouping accuracy.  \n   - **Expected Response:** A successful 200 OK response providing separate density counts for each boundary polygon, grouped by the requested tags, with zero counts for non-existent tags. The data should correctly reflect hierarchical nesting, i.e., larger boundary counts should equal or exceed smaller boundary counts for shared tags.  \n\n2. **Title:** Update Boundary Definition and Verify Consistent Density Counts  \n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/count/density/groupBy/boundary/groupBy/tag  \n   - **Description:** Modify the parameters to request density for the initially smaller polygon boundary but with an added buffer area. The same tags from step 1 are queried again to verify if the counts increase logically with the extended boundary. This simulates the effect of dynamic boundary modifications.  \n   - **Expected Response:** A 200 OK response with updated density counts showing equal or increased values compared to step 1 for the small boundary, consistent across all tags. Counts should not decrease unexpectedly, which would indicate boundary handling defects.  \n\n3. **Title:** Query Density with Overlapping Boundaries and Disjoint Tags  \n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/count/density/groupBy/boundary/groupBy/tag  \n   - **Description:** Send a request with two partially overlapping boundaries, and group by two sets of tags: one set completely disjoint from the other (no shared tags). This tests the API\u2019s ability to segregate density counts per boundary and tag grouping, ensuring no data contamination between groups.  \n   - **Expected Response:** 200 OK with distinct density counts for each boundary and tag group, confirming accurate group-by application. No tag counts should appear under wrong boundaries or groups. Results for overlapping areas should sum up logically without duplication.  \n\n4. **Title:** Edge Case: Empty Tag List with Valid Boundaries  \n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/count/density/groupBy/boundary/groupBy/tag  \n   - **Description:** Repeat the request with valid boundary polygons but an empty array or omitted tag parameter to validate handling of missing or empty tag grouping. Tests response defaults when no tags specified.  \n   - **Expected Response:** A 200 OK response either returning aggregated density grouped only by boundaries (no tag grouping) or a clear informative error message if tags are mandatory. Validations should ensure no system errors occur from empty or missing tag lists.  \n\n5. **Title:** Invalid Boundary Polygon Format and Unsupported Tags  \n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/count/density/groupBy/boundary/groupBy/tag  \n   - **Description:** Intentionally send malformed GeoJSON boundary definitions (e.g., self-intersecting polygons, invalid coordinates) and include tags with special characters or invalid encoding to test input validation.  \n   - **Expected Response:** A 400 Bad Request with detailed error messages specifying issues in boundary format and tag parameters. No partial processing should occur, and the system should reject the entire request gracefully without internal server errors.  \n\n6. **Title:** Concurrent Density Requests with Varying Boundaries and Tags  \n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/count/density/groupBy/boundary/groupBy/tag (multiple parallel calls)  \n   - **Description:** Execute multiple concurrent GET requests with combinations of boundaries and tags, mixing large and small polygons and common and rare tags, simulating multi-user environment load and state management robustness.  \n   - **Expected Response:** All requests complete with consistent, accurate density counts. No race conditions, mismatched data, or erroneous cross-request contaminations occur. Response times should remain within acceptable thresholds, and no request should fail unpredictably.  \n\n**Summary:**  \nThis comprehensive scenario sequence validates GET /elements/count/density/groupBy/boundary/groupBy/tag endpoint for handling complex boundary geometries including nesting and overlap, dynamic boundary adjustments, tag grouping correctness, robust input validation for malformed data, behavior on empty tags, and system stability under concurrent loads. Together, these steps expose potential bugs related to data consistency, spatial grouping accuracy, input sanitation, concurrency issues, and error management.", "usage": {"total_tokens": 106731, "total_cost": 0.0490344}, "unique_endpoints": {"200": [], "300": [], "400": ["GET /elements/count"], "500": 0}, "total_true_result": 0, "total_false_result": 3}
