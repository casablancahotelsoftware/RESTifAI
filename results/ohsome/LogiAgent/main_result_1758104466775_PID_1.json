It validates that counting aggregation functions correctly, that filters affect results logically, and that the system maintains state consistency without side effects after concurrent or erroneous requests. It also ensures the service gracefully handles malformed inputs and unknown tag filters without crashing or returning unexpected errors.", "usage": {"total_tokens": 28817, "total_cost": 0.013832}, "unique_endpoints": {"200": [], "300": [], "400": [], "500": 0}, "total_true_result": 0, "total_false_result": 0}
