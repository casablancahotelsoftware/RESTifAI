This establishes a baseline count and groups by common tag values (e.g., `primary`, `secondary`).\n     - Second, send another request to count OSM elements grouped by multiple tags simultaneously (e.g., `\"highway\"` and `\"surface\"`), mixing nested grouping in a single request payload.\n     - Third, repeat the request but this time include a polygonal spatial boundary filter to restrict OSM elements counted within this geographic area.\n     - Fourth, send a malformed request with mismatched tag group keys (e.g., empty tags array or invalid tag keys) combined with a circle boundary filter to verify error handling.\n   - **Expected Responses:** \n     - The first and second calls should return well-structured counts grouped by their respective tags or combined tag groups, with HTTP 200 OK.\n     - The counts in the second call should logically correspond to intersections of tags (e.g., grouped counts must not exceed counts of the individual tag groups).\n     - The third call should return counts reflecting only elements inside the spatial polygon, which should be equal or less than counts without boundary.\n     - The fourth call should return descriptive 400 Bad Request errors indicating missing or invalid tags or boundary parameters, with no partial data.\n   \n2. **Title:** Data Consistency and State Validation Through Sequential Incremental Grouping Requests\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/count/groupBy/tag\n   - **Description:** \n     - Begin by sending a request to count elements grouped by a common tag (e.g., `\"building\"`).\n     - Then send a second request increasing the grouping keys by adding an additional tag (e.g., `\"building\"` and `\"height\"`), verifying that counts are consistent subsets of the first response (no unexpected increase in counts).\n     - Subsequently, send a third request changing only the order of tags in the grouping array to verify response order invariance.\n     - Finally, run multiple repeated identical requests to observe caching or rate-limit related behaviors and confirm consistency of counts and response time.\n   - **Expected Responses:**\n     - Counts from the second grouping call should be consistent with the first call, with no inflated aggregate counts.\n     - The third call\u2019s response should logically match the second call\u2019s counts, demonstrating order-independence in grouping parameters.\n     - Repeat calls should consistently return identical counts with HTTP 200 and no internal server errors or rate-limit responses.\n   \n3. **Title:** Test Handling of Large and Complex Tag Grouping Combinations with Concurrency\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/count/groupBy/tag\n   - **Description:** \n     - Send multiple concurrent requests with large arrays of tags (e.g., 10-15 different tag keys) for grouping to validate system performance and correctness under load.\n     - Include one request with overlapping tags that could cause nested or redundant groupings (e.g., `\"amenity\"`, `\"amenity:parking\"`).\n     - Mix in calls with boundary filters of various types (bbox, bcircle) and missing or incomplete boundary data to check system input validation and concurrency safety.\n   - **Expected Responses:** \n     - All concurrent requests must complete without causing server errors or data corruption.\n     - The API should respond consistently with the correct grouping counts for large tag arrays.\n     - Redundant or nested tag keys should either be normalized or cause meaningful validation errors with 400 responses.\n     - Requests missing required boundary details should fail fast with informative errors, not causing side effects on other requests.\n   \n4. **Title:** Verify Idempotency and Side Effects in Counting Elements Grouped by Tags\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/count/groupBy/tag\n   - **Description:** \n     - Execute the same request multiple times with identical parameters to verify idempotency, ensuring no variation in counts or unexpected delays.\n     - Update (simulate via separate administrative API or dataset update if available) the underlying OSM dataset between calls and rerun the count grouped by the same tags to verify updated counts reflect dataset changes.\n     - Test deletion or update scenarios if any mutation APIs exist by creating/removing elements tagged accordingly and verifying counts decrement/increment accordingly.\n     - Since mutation APIs are not indicated in the list, simulate by repeated runs to check state stability over time.\n   - **Expected Responses:** \n     - Idempotent requests should return identical count results.\n     - Counts should reflect data freshness accurately if the data changes between requests (if mutation APIs not present, then counts should remain stable).\n     - No caching artifacts or stale data responses should occur.\n     - No unexpected errors or server state corruption due to repeated or overlapping calls.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis comprehensive multi-step scenario exercises the single available endpoint in various complex and realistic usage patterns: single and multiple tag grouping, with and without spatial boundaries, input validation for malformed or incomplete requests, performance and concurrency robustness with large inputs, and stability, idempotency, and data consistency over repeated calls. The scenario is designed to uncover bugs related to parameter handling, grouping logic inconsistencies, spatial filtering correctness, input validation, concurrency issues, and state management, critical for data aggregation APIs working on large spatial datasets.", "usage": {"total_tokens": 20147, "total_cost": 0.011438}, "unique_endpoints": {"200": [], "300": [], "400": [], "500": 0}, "total_true_result": 0, "total_false_result": 0}
