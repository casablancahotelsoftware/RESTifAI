The request includes a valid bounding box coordinate set representing a specific geographic area. This initial query establishes baseline data for perimeter values grouped by this boundary type.\n   - **Expected Response:**  \n     - HTTP 200 OK  \n     - JSON response containing perimeter data correctly grouped by the given bounding box.  \n     - Each group should include valid perimeter measurements consistent with the spatial area specified.  \n\n2. **Title:** Perimeter Grouping by Boundary Type - Circle within Overlapping Area\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/perimeter/groupBy/boundary\n   - **Description:** Request perimeter grouping using a circular boundary (bcircle) overlapping the bounding box from the previous step. This tests handling of boundary overlap and correctness of perimeter calculation when boundaries intersect.\n   - **Expected Response:**  \n     - HTTP 200 OK  \n     - Response should include perimeter groupings that partially overlap with those from step 1, with perimeter values reflecting the circle's spatial coverage.  \n     - No duplication of data outside the circle's limit should appear.\n\n3. **Title:** Perimeter Grouping by Boundary Type - Polygon Disjoint from Previous Boundaries\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/perimeter/groupBy/boundary\n   - **Description:** Request perimeter data grouped by a polygon (bpoly) boundary geographically disjoint from the previous bounding box and circle boundaries. This verifies isolation and independence of grouped perimeter calculations by distinct boundary shapes.\n   - **Expected Response:**  \n     - HTTP 200 OK  \n     - Perimeter groupings should be exclusive to the polygon area and show no overlap with previous bounding box or circle results.  \n     - Ensures correct spatial filtering per distinct boundary.\n\n4. **Title:** Repeated Queries with Same Boundaries to Check Data Consistency and Caching\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/perimeter/groupBy/boundary\n   - **Description:** Perform two consecutive requests using the bounding box boundary from step 1 to verify consistent perimeter results and detect any caching or state-related anomalies.\n   - **Expected Response:**  \n     - Both requests return HTTP 200 OK with identical perimeter grouping data.  \n     - No discrepancies or stale data should arise, ensuring idempotence and data stability.\n\n5. **Title:** Malformed Boundary Input to Trigger Validation Errors\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/perimeter/groupBy/boundary\n   - **Description:** Submit a request with malformed or incomplete boundary parameters (e.g., missing coordinates or invalid numeric values) to validate server-side input verification and error handling.\n   - **Expected Response:**  \n     - HTTP 400 Bad Request  \n     - A clear error message indicating which boundary parameters are incorrect or missing.  \n     - API must not perform any perimeter calculations or return partial results.\n\n6. **Title:** Combination of Overlapping Boundaries in a Single Request (Edge Case)\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/perimeter/groupBy/boundary\n   - **Description:** Craft a request including multiple boundary definitions in one call (e.g., bounding box and polygon) when the API is documented to accept only one boundary per call. This tests API robustness against unsupported multi-boundary inputs.\n   - **Expected Response:**  \n     - HTTP 400 Bad Request or a clear error message explaining boundary parameter constraint violation.  \n     - No perimeter data should be computed or returned.  \n     - Validates input constraint enforcement.\n\n7. **Title:** Boundary Parameters with Extreme Geographic Values to Test Limits\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/perimeter/groupBy/boundary\n   - **Description:** Request perimeter grouping with bounding boxes or polygons specified at geographic extremes (near poles or international date line) to verify correct spatial calculations and boundary handling in edge geographic zones.\n   - **Expected Response:**  \n     - HTTP 200 OK if supported, otherwise a well-defined error with explanation of unsupported area.  \n     - If OK, perimeter values should be accurately calculated for these edge zones without overflow or incorrect grouping.\n\n8. **Title:** Rapid Sequential Requests Using Different Boundary Types to Test Rate and State Handling\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/perimeter/groupBy/boundary (multiple calls)\n   - **Description:** Fire a quick sequence of perimeter grouping requests alternating between bounding box, circle, and polygon boundaries to assess server stability, concurrency management, and correctness under rapid mixed-input loads.\n   - **Expected Response:**  \n     - Each request returns HTTP 200 OK with correct perimeter groups respective to the boundary type.  \n     - No data contamination or cross-request mixing should occur.  \n     - Server response times should remain within acceptable limits to indicate robust handling.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis comprehensive scenario sequence explores the GET /elements/perimeter/groupBy/boundary endpoint's ability to correctly process varied boundary types (bbox, bcircle, bpoly), including overlapping and disjoint spatial queries, consistent repeated requests for idempotency, as well as malformed input validation and parameter constraint enforcement. It further stresses limits with extreme geographic inputs and concurrency through rapid sequential queries.
