The requests sent boundaries as query parameters and not with the required form content types. The server consistently rejects them with clear error messages, showing stable, stateless handling without cross-request contamination. However, the expected 200 OK responses with accurate, isolated counts are not achieved due to request format issues, causing functional failure of this test.", "response": "Three HTTP 400 responses with unsupported content-type errors indicating the need for multipart/form-data or application/x-www-form-urlencoded."}], "test_scenario_response_message": "1. **Title:** Sequential and Mixed-Type Boundary Counts for OSM Contributions\n    - **API Endpoint:** GET /contributions/count/groupBy/boundary\n    - **Description:** Initiate a request to get counts of OSM contributions grouped by a polygon boundary (bpoly) representing a specific city district. Validate the shape and accuracy of returned boundaries and counts. The response should include multiple groupings corresponding to sub-boundaries within the polygon.\n    - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with a JSON body containing counts accurately grouped by the polygon boundary components. Counts should be numeric and consistent with known OSM data ranges for that area.\n\n2. **Title:** Overlapping Boundary Query with Mixed Types\n    - **API Endpoint:** GET /contributions/count/groupBy/boundary\n    - **Description:** Perform a request with overlapping mixed boundary types: a bounding box (bbox) and a circle (bcircle) partially overlapping with the previous polygon. This tests whether the endpoint correctly calculates contributions count when boundaries overlap spatially and whether it returns separate grouped counts for each boundary component.\n    - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with a JSON response detailing counts grouped distinctly for bbox and bcircle boundaries. The counts should not double-count contributions in overlapping areas or should clearly document behavior if double counting occurs.\n\n3. **Title:** Repeated Boundary Count Query to Assess Idempotency and Caching\n    - **API Endpoint:** GET /contributions/count/groupBy/boundary\n    - **Description:** Repeat the first polygon boundary request multiple times consecutively to check for consistent responses and to test server-side caching or state issues that might cause stale or inconsistent results.\n    - **Expected Response:** Multiple HTTP 200 OK responses, all containing identical counts and grouping structures identical to the initial query response. No unexpected variations should occur across repetitions.\n\n4. **Title:** Invalid Boundary Parameter Submission\n    - **API Endpoint:** GET /contributions/count/groupBy/boundary\n    - **Description:** Send a request with an intentionally malformed polygon boundary parameter (e.g., incorrect coordinate format, missing closure of polygon, or invalid numeric range) to test robust input validation and error handling.\n    - **Expected Response:** HTTP 400 Bad Request with a descriptive error message indicating the boundary parameter's invalidity, specifying which part of the input is malformed or out of range.\n\n5. **Title:** Large and Complex Boundary Query Stress Test\n    - **API Endpoint:** GET /contributions/count/groupBy/boundary\n    - **Description:** Query with a very large polygon boundary encompassing an entire metropolitan region with multiple nested sub-boundaries (bpolys) to test API performance, backend processing efficiency, and correct grouping of counts across a complex multi-boundary spatial request.\n    - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with a detailed JSON response showing counts grouped by each sub-boundary within the large polygon. Response time should be within acceptable limits (e.g., under 10 seconds), and counts should be consistent with the expected density based on OSM data volume for that region.\n\n6. **Title:** Concurrent Requests with Differing Boundaries to Test State Isolation\n    - **API Endpoint:** GET /contributions/count/groupBy/boundary\n    - **Description:** Simultaneously issue multiple GET requests from different clients with varying boundary types and spatial extents (mixing bbox, bcircle, and bpoly) to validate that the server handles concurrency correctly without state leakage, cross-request interference, or corrupted aggregation results.\n    - **Expected Response:** Each concurrent response should be HTTP 200 OK with accurate counts specific to the requested boundary, with no data contamination or leakage between requests. Response times should be reasonable, and there should be no server errors or race conditions.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis scenario sequence performs detailed validation of the GET /contributions/count/groupBy/boundary endpoint by exercising complex spatial queries involving polygon, bounding box, and circle boundaries. It tests input validation rigor, idempotency via repeated queries, caching behavior, concurrency robustness, and the API\u2019s ability to handle large, overlapping, and malformed spatial data inputs. This combination is designed to uncover subtle defects in spatial grouping logic, input parameter processing, caching or state management bugs, concurrency handling, and error reporting quality, ensuring the endpoint reliably delivers accurate and consistent contribution counts under diverse real-world usage patterns.", "usage": {"total_tokens": 498848, "total_cost": 0.2089496}, "unique_endpoints": {"200": [], "300": [], "400": ["GET /contributions/count"], "500": 0}, "total_true_result": 0, "total_false_result": 9}
