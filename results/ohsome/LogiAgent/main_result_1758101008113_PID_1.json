{"all_cnt": 0, "all_request_sequence": [], "right_results": [], "wrong_results": [], "test_scenario_response_message": "**Test Scenario: Validate POST /contributions/count Endpoint for Accurate Contribution Counting and State Consistency**\n\n1. **Title:** Initial Count Retrieval with Valid Geographic and Temporal Filters  \n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /contributions/count  \n   - **Description:** Submit a request with a well-formed polygon boundary representing a moderate-sized geographic area, and include a time range filter to count OSM contributions within that spatial-temporal window.  \n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with a numeric count that reflects contributions accurately within the given area and timeframe. The count must be non-negative and consistent with known data volumes if possible.\n\n2. **Title:** Count Retrieval with Overlapping but Slightly Altered Boundaries  \n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /contributions/count  \n   - **Description:** Submit a subsequent request using a polygon boundary that partially overlaps the original area used in step 1 but extends slightly beyond it. Time range remains the same.  \n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with a count that is greater than or equal to the count from step 1, reflecting the expanded area correctly. This checks spatial boundary handling and aggregation correctness.\n\n3. **Title:** Count Retrieval with Invalid Polygon Data  \n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /contributions/count  \n   - **Description:** Submit a request containing malformed or self-intersecting polygon geometry to test input validation and error handling for spatial parameters.  \n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 400 Bad Request with an informative error message indicating invalid polygon geometry. The system should not process or count contributions when spatial inputs are corrupted.\n\n4. **Title:** Count Retrieval with Missing or Empty Boundary Parameter  \n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /contributions/count  \n   - **Description:** Submit a request omitting the boundary parameter or providing it as an empty object/string to test mandatory input enforcement. Include a valid time range.  \n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 400 Bad Request indicating that the required spatial boundary parameter is missing or invalid. The API should enforce input completeness.\n\n5. **Title:** Sequential Requests to Validate Consistency Under Repeated Calls  \n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /contributions/count (Repeated 3 Times with Identical Valid Inputs)  \n   - **Description:** Resubmit the exact valid request from step 1 three consecutive times to ensure that the API returns consistent counts and maintains no unintended state changes from repeated queries.  \n   - **Expected Response:** Each of the three calls should return identical contribution counts with HTTP 200 OK responses, demonstrating idempotency and data consistency across repeated queries.\n\n6. **Title:** Count Retrieval with Future Time Range Yielding Zero Results  \n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /contributions/count  \n   - **Description:** Submit a request where the time range is set entirely in the future (no contributions could exist yet) alongside a valid boundary.  \n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with a contribution count of zero, demonstrating correct handling of temporal filters and empty result sets without errors.\n\n7. **Title:** Count Retrieval with Excessively Large Polygon Causing Potential Performance Constraints  \n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /contributions/count  \n   - **Description:** Provide a polygon boundary covering an extremely large area (e.g., entire country or continent) combined with a multi-year time range to test server resilience and stability under heavy aggregation demands.  \n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with a valid numeric count or a graceful HTTP 503 Service Unavailable if server load is exceeded, accompanied by a descriptive error explaining temporary resource limitations. This checks the system's capacity to handle large requests or fail gracefully.\n\n8. **Title:** Concurrent Requests with Mixed Valid and Invalid Inputs  \n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /contributions/count (Multiple Calls in Parallel)  \n   - **Description:** Simultaneously submit a batch of requests including valid spatial and temporal filters, malformed polygons, missing parameters, and future date ranges to test concurrency handling, proper isolation, and consistent error responses under load.  \n   - **Expected Response:** Valid requests return accurate counts with HTTP 200 OK; invalid requests yield appropriate HTTP 400 errors. No interference or data leakage between concurrent requests should occur, ensuring thread safety and request isolation.\n\n9. **Title:** Logical Mismatch Test: Time Range End Date Before Start Date  \n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /contributions/count  \n   - **Description:** Submit a request with a valid polygon boundary, but set the time range so the end date precedes the start date, testing temporal parameter validation.  \n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 400 Bad Request with clear error messaging indicating invalid time range parameters. The API should reject logically incorrect temporal inputs.\n\n10. **Title:** Verify No Hidden Dependencies on Previous Calls  \n    - **API Endpoint:** POST /contributions/count  \n    - **Description:** After completing multiple tests, submit a final valid request with spatial and temporal filters differing from previous calls to confirm that results are independent of prior queries and that clearing or caching mechanisms do not cause stale or incoherent counts.  \n    - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with a count consistent with the provided parameters and differing from previous calls where appropriate, confirming statelessness and proper request processing.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis detailed scenario tests the only available API endpoint POST /contributions/count through a variety of valid, invalid, boundary, and concurrency conditions. It focuses on spatial and temporal filtering correctness, robust input validation for polygon geometry and time parameters, consistency and idempotency of repeated and concurrent requests, system resilience under large data aggregation, and proper error handling. This sequence is designed to uncover defects related to input validation, data accuracy, state management, concurrency safety, and server performance, ensuring that contribution counts returned are reliable, consistent, and properly scoped.", "usage": {"total_tokens": 45849, "total_cost": 0.022405200000000004}, "unique_endpoints": {"200": [], "300": [], "400": [], "500": 0}, "total_true_result": 0, "total_false_result": 0}
