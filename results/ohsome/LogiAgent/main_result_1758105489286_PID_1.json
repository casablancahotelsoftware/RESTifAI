The sequence will mix repeated calls with the same key to check for state inconsistencies or caching issues, and calls with missing or malformed key parameters to test validation and error handling.  \n    - **Expected Response:**  \n      - For valid keys: HTTP 200 with a JSON object accurately showing counts of OSM elements grouped by the key, with counts consistent across repeated calls.  \n      - For invalid or missing keys: HTTP 400 Bad Request with error messages that clearly specify the validation failure or missing parameter, without server errors or crashes.  \n\n2. **Title:** Cross-verification of Counts Grouped by Different Keys Reflecting Consistent Aggregation Logic  \n    - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/count/groupBy/key  \n    - **Description:** Fetch counts grouped by a set of related keys sequentially, such as \"amenity\", \"shop\", and \"leisure\", and verify if aggregation logic is consistent (e.g., total counts do not contradict each other, sum of counts grouped by sub-keys should logically not exceed total elements). Introduce concurrency by firing parallel GET requests for these keys and compare aggregated outputs for inconsistencies or race conditions.  \n    - **Expected Response:**  \n      - HTTP 200 for all concurrent requests with accurate counts.  \n      - Aggregations logically consistent: e.g., the aggregated results of sub-category keys do not exceed overall element counts.  \n      - No unexpected errors or incomplete data in concurrent responses.  \n\n3. **Title:** Validate Idempotency and Stability of Element Counts Grouped by Key under Data Updates Simulation  \n    - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/count/groupBy/key  \n    - **Description:** Simulate updates on the underlying OSM data externally (e.g., adding or removing elements tagged with specific keys) and verify that repeated calls to this endpoint reflect updated counts. Although direct data updates are outside the API, the scenario tests system behavior assuming underlying data changes (can be emulated via test environment). Verify that counts before and after simulated updates differ as expected and that repeated requests without changes return identical results, ensuring idempotency and data consistency.  \n    - **Expected Response:**  \n      - Initial calls: accurate counts reflecting base data.  \n      - After simulated data updates: counts reflect added or removed elements appropriately.  \n      - Repeated calls without data changes return consistent, identical counts.  \n      - No stale or cached inconsistent data returned unexpectedly.  \n\nSummary:  \nThis test scenario sequence thoroughly exercises the GET /elements/count/groupBy/key endpoint through varied realistic and edge case inputs. It verifies correct aggregation of OSM element counts by key, robust input validation, concurrency handling, idempotency, data consistency over simulated updates, and error messaging clarity. This comprehensive multi-step interaction helps identify issues related to state management, aggregation logic flaws, concurrency race conditions, and inconsistent error handling in key-based grouping counts of OSM elements.", "usage": {"total_tokens": 82541, "total_cost": 0.037053199999999994}, "unique_endpoints": {"200": [], "300": [], "400": ["GET /elements/count"], "500": 0}, "total_true_result": 0, "total_false_result": 3}
