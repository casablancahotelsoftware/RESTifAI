Then, repeat requests with various query parameters or headers designed to test boundary conditions, such as geographic boundaries or filters if supported.\n   - **Expected Response:** \n     - Initially, a 200 OK response with a well-structured JSON payload showing user density grouped by their types.\n     - Subsequent requests should consistently return 200 OK with logically consistent density data, reflecting changes only when valid filters or parameters are applied.\n     - Requests with unsupported or malformed parameters should result in proper 400 Bad Request errors with descriptive messages.\n   \n2. **Title:** Validate Data Consistency Across Sequential Data Updates (Simulated)\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /users/count/density/groupBy/type\n   - **Description:** Query the user density data grouped by type multiple times in rapid succession to simulate near real-time data changes, comparing successive responses to detect unexpected fluctuations or interpolation mismatches that are not explainable by normal data dynamics.\n   - **Expected Response:** Responses should be consistent or show expected incremental data changes if the system supports real-time updates. Any unexpected zero densities or negative values, or missing groups, should be flagged as defects indicating possible data aggregation or caching issues.\n\n3. **Title:** Test Handling of Unsupported HTTP Methods and Headers\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /users/count/density/groupBy/type (Unsupported method)\n   - **Description:** Issue POST requests (and other unsupported HTTP methods like PUT or DELETE) to the endpoint to check if the system correctly rejects these with method not allowed errors. Vary the use of headers, including invalid content-type headers or extra custom headers, to ensure robust method and header validation.\n   - **Expected Response:** The API should respond with HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed for unsupported methods and a descriptive error related to invalid headers or methods. No data should be returned, and error messages should clearly explain the issue.\n\n4. **Title:** Test Data Integrity When Querying with Conflicting Parameters\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /users/count/density/groupBy/type\n   - **Description:** Simulate requests including conflicting query parameters if any are supported (e.g., contradictory bounding box coordinates, invalid grouping options in combination with type filters), to verify the system's error handling and consistency in rejecting or resolving conflicting input.\n   - **Expected Response:** The server should return an HTTP 400 Bad Request or a clear error response explaining parameter conflicts. No partial or inconsistent data should be returned, and the API should not crash or return unexpected status codes.\n\n5. **Title:** Stress Test Under Concurrent Access for Race Conditions\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /users/count/density/groupBy/type\n   - **Description:** Simultaneously issue a large number of concurrent GET requests to this endpoint to simulate high load or many users requesting the density data grouped by type concurrently. This tests thread safety, caching mechanisms, and consistent response delivery under load.\n   - **Expected Response:** The API should reliably respond with consistent 200 OK responses showing user density grouped by type without corruption or incomplete data. Performance degradation is acceptable within limits, but server errors (500, 503) or data inconsistency signals a concurrency defect.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis test scenario combines multiple interaction types with the GET /users/count/density/groupBy/type API endpoint, covering basic valid queries, input validation with conflicting parameters, rejection of unsupported methods, real-time data consistency checks, and concurrency stress testing. It is designed to uncover subtle bugs related to data aggregation errors, concurrency flaws, state management problems, improper input validation, and method handling inconsistencies, providing a robust verification of data accuracy and system resilience.", "usage": {"total_tokens": 69527, "total_cost": 0.0326072}, "unique_endpoints": {"200": [], "300": [], "400": ["GET /users/count"], "500": 0}, "total_true_result": 0, "total_false_result": 4}
