Include requests targeting overlapping geographical boundaries by specifying `bbox` or polygon parameters in the query (assuming the API supports spatial filters) to test how user densities are grouped by tags under complex spatial conditions.\n     Subsequently, execute repeated requests with the same tag and boundary parameters to verify response consistency and idempotency.\n   - **Expected Response:** \n     - Successful responses (HTTP 200) with JSON payloads showing accurate user density counts grouped by the requested tags within the specified boundaries.\n     - For invalid or malformed tags, expect HTTP 400 Bad Request with descriptive error messages.\n     - For overlapping boundary queries, user densities should logically reflect cumulative or intersecting counts without duplication.\n     - Repeated calls with identical parameters should return consistent data without unexpected fluctuation.\n\n2. **Title:** Validate Data Consistency and Error Handling with Dynamic Tag Filters and Complex Boundaries\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /users/count/density/groupBy/tag\n   - **Description:** \n     - Send a request using a complex polygon boundary encompassing multiple known OSM areas along with one or more legitimate tags. \n     - Follow immediately with a request using a smaller polygon subset of the first boundary with the same tags.\n     - Compare the counts from both responses to ensure that the larger polygon's user density is equal to or greater than the smaller one for each tag group.\n     - Intentionally modify tags to mixtures of valid and invalid values to observe whether the API partially processes valid tags or rejects the whole request.\n     - Attempt requests with missing required query parameters or unsupported HTTP methods to test error handling robustness.\n   - **Expected Response:**\n     - The larger boundary request should return user densities that are logically consistent and not less than those returned by the smaller boundary query.\n     - For requests with mixed valid/invalid tags, API should ideally return partial results for valid tags along with warnings/errors for invalid tags, or clearly reject the request with HTTP 400.\n     - Invalid method usage or missing parameters should yield appropriate HTTP 4xx error codes with explanatory messages.\n\n3. **Title:** Test Concurrency and Idempotency of User Density Grouped by Tag Queries\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /users/count/density/groupBy/tag\n   - **Description:** \n     Simultaneously send multiple concurrent GET requests with the exact same parameters (tags and boundary) to assess concurrency handling and potential race conditions in response generation.\n     Follow this with sequential repeated requests to confirm idempotency and stable state management.\n   - **Expected Response:**\n     - All concurrent responses should be successful, non-conflicting (no partial data or corrupted payloads), and identical.\n     - Sequential repeated calls with the same parameters should return stable, consistent user density data, indicating proper state consistency and idempotent processing.\n\n4. **Title:** Verify Interaction with User Count Density Aggregated by Other Dimensions (Cross-API Consistency)\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /users/count/density/groupBy/tag, and (if available from previous scenarios or integration interfaces) GET /users/count/density\n   - **Description:** \n     Cross-reference total user count density data from the general endpoint (GET /users/count/density) with the aggregated counts grouped by tags.\n     The sum of user densities across all tags from GET /users/count/density/groupBy/tag should generally be less than or equal to the total user count from GET /users/count/density for the same spatial boundary.\n   - **Expected Response:** \n     - Numeric aggregates from the grouped-by-tag endpoint should be consistent with, but not exceed, the total counts from the general user density API.\n     - Any inconsistency or anomalies (e.g., sums greater than total count) could indicate flaws in aggregation or data grouping logic.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis test scenario sequence exhaustively exercises GET /users/count/density/groupBy/tag focusing on requests with varied tag inputs, complex spatial boundaries, and repeated/concurrent invocations. It aims to uncover data consistency issues, validation errors on malformed inputs, concurrency handling defects, and cross-API aggregation mismatches. It rigorously tests how well the API processes diverse realistic queries, manages state, and produces stable, correct aggregations grouped by user tags across spatial contexts.", "usage": {"total_tokens": 19109, "total_cost": 0.0107564}, "unique_endpoints": {"200": [], "300": [], "400": [], "500": 0}, "total_true_result": 0, "total_false_result": 0}
