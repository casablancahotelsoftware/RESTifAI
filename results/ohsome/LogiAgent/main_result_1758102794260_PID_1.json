{"all_cnt": 0, "all_request_sequence": [], "right_results": [], "wrong_results": [], "test_scenario_response_message": "**Title:** Validate Area Calculation Consistency and Edge Case Handling for OSM Elements\n\n1. **Initial Area Calculation for a Standard Polygon Area**\n    - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/area\n    - **Description:** Submit a well-formed polygon representing a valid geographical area (e.g., a known city block or park boundary) to calculate the area of contained OSM elements.\n    - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with a JSON response containing the computed area value. The area should be accurate and consistent with known data or approximated polygon footprint.\n\n2. **Repeat Area Calculation with Slightly Modified Polygon**\n    - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/area\n    - **Description:** Submit a similar polygon with slightly altered boundaries (e.g., an edge shifted by a minimal amount) to verify that the API reflects the correct and expected change in area calculation.\n    - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with a JSON area value slightly different from the initial polygon\u2019s result, logically matching the smaller or larger polygon dimensions.\n\n3. **Area Calculation with Overlapping Multiple Polygons in One Request**\n    - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/area\n    - **Description:** Submit a request containing multiple overlapping polygon areas to check how the system aggregates or distinguishes areas, and whether overlapping portions are double counted or handled properly.\n    - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with a combined or detailed breakdown of areas by polygon. The system should not double count overlapping regions, reflecting consistent aggregation logic.\n\n4. **Area Calculation with Malformed Polygon (Invalid Geometry)**\n    - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/area\n    - **Description:** Send a request with invalid polygon geometry such as self-intersecting lines or invalid coordinate sequences to test input validation and error response.\n    - **Expected Response:** HTTP 400 Bad Request with a meaningful error message specifying the invalid geometry issue, preventing further processing.\n\n5. **Area Calculation with Empty or Missing Polygon Coordinates**\n    - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/area\n    - **Description:** Submit a request with an empty polygon coordinate list or missing polygon data fields to verify proper error handling for mandatory input absence.\n    - **Expected Response:** HTTP 400 Bad Request with explicit error indicating missing or empty polygon payloads.\n\n6. **Area Calculation for a Large-Scale Polygon Spanning Multiple Boundaries**\n    - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/area\n    - **Description:** Use a large polygon covering several administrative boundaries or OSM regions to test system handling of complex, large spatial queries and aggregation correctness.\n    - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with a total combined area value that is consistent with multiple boundary inclusion, and no truncation or loss of data.\n\n7. **Concurrent Submissions of Area Calculation Requests with Overlapping Boundaries**\n    - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/area\n    - **Description:** Simultaneously send multiple POST requests with overlapping polygons from different clients to test concurrency handling and consistency of results amid race conditions.\n    - **Expected Response:** All requests return HTTP 200 OK with individually reliable area calculations. No data corruption or cross-request interference should occur.\n\n8. **Recalculate Initial Polygon Area to Confirm Stable Results and Cache Handling**\n    - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/area\n    - **Description:** Resubmit the initial polygon from step 1 to check if the system returns consistent area values, checking for caching effectiveness or calculation stability over multiple calls.\n    - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with an area result matching the initial calculation precisely or within an acceptable minimal variance.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis test scenario extensively evaluates the POST /elements/area API by sequentially submitting polygons with varying complexity and correctness to expose potential calculation inaccuracies, error handling weaknesses, content validation issues, concurrency flaws, and stability inconsistencies. It tests logical aggregation for overlapping areas, system robustness with invalid inputs, large scale spatial queries, and verifies consistent repetitive processing, thereby ensuring reliable and precise OSM element area computations.", "usage": {"total_tokens": 32022, "total_cost": 0.0156456}, "unique_endpoints": {"200": [], "300": [], "400": [], "500": 0}, "total_true_result": 0, "total_false_result": 0}
