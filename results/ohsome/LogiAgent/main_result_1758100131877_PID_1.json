The polygon should be a valid GeoJSON or a similar spatial format as required by the API.\n   - **Expected Response:** A 200 OK status with a JSON payload containing area ratios grouped by element types within the polygon. Ratios should sum up to approximately 1.0, confirming correct aggregation.\n\n2. **Title:** Validate Consistency of Area Ratios with Modified Boundary \u2013 Smaller Polygon Inside the First Boundary\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/area/ratio/groupBy/boundary\n   - **Description:** Submit a smaller polygon boundary fully contained inside the previous polygon to verify the ratio decreases or adjusts logically with the new spatial constraint. This checks for correct spatial filtering and data reduction.\n   - **Expected Response:** A 200 OK with a JSON response showing area ratios consistent with a subset of the first polygon\u2019s data, with total ratios logically less or equal to the initial overall coverage.\n\n3. **Title:** Submit an Overlapping Polygon Boundary to Test Aggregation Behavior with Partially Shared Areas\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/area/ratio/groupBy/boundary\n   - **Description:** Use a polygon that partially overlaps with the first polygon boundary and extends beyond it. This tests if the API correctly aggregates element area ratios for overlapping geographic regions without duplication errors.\n   - **Expected Response:** 200 OK response with a JSON body showing area ratios reflecting the combined element presence within the overlap and the extended area. Ratios inside shared areas should reflect combined attributes without double counting.\n\n4. **Title:** Submit an Invalid Polygon Geometry to Test Input Validation\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/area/ratio/groupBy/boundary\n   - **Description:** Provide a malformed polygon such as self-intersecting coordinates or incomplete geometry data to verify the API returns a proper error response.\n   - **Expected Response:** A 400 Bad Request or equivalent client error indicating invalid geometry input, with a clear error message describing the failure cause.\n\n5. **Title:** Rapid Sequential Calls to Assess Idempotency and Response Stability\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/area/ratio/groupBy/boundary\n   - **Description:** Repeat the request with the original large polygon boundary multiple times in quick succession to test caching behavior, idempotency, and stable response generation under load.\n   - **Expected Response:** Multiple 200 OK responses with consistent area ratio data in each response, confirming server stability and consistent computation.\n\n6. **Title:** Large Complex Polygon Boundary to Test Performance and Response Time\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/area/ratio/groupBy/boundary\n   - **Description:** Send a very large or highly complex polygon boundary covering multiple administrative regions to evaluate server performance, timeout handling, and data aggregation scalability.\n   - **Expected Response:** A 200 OK with correctly aggregated ratio data albeit possibly with slightly increased response time. If timeout occurs, it should be gracefully handled with informative error messages.\n\n7. **Title:** Send Multiple Requests Simultaneously to Test Concurrent Processing and Data Integrity\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/area/ratio/groupBy/boundary (used concurrently)\n   - **Description:** Concurrently send a mix of valid large polygon boundary requests and smaller boundary requests to evaluate if API handles concurrency properly without data race or response cross-contamination.\n   - **Expected Response:** All responses return 200 OK with correct area ratios respective to each input boundary. No corrupted or incorrect aggregated results due to concurrency.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis scenario sequence thoroughly tests the POST /elements/area/ratio/groupBy/boundary API endpoint by exercising complex spatial queries, boundary overlap handling, input validation, performance under large requests, result consistency on repetitive queries, and concurrency robustness. It aims to reveal bugs related to spatial aggregation correctness, input format validation, caching or concurrency side effects, and server performance limits, ensuring reliable area ratio computations for OSM elements grouped by arbitrary geographic boundaries.", "usage": {"total_tokens": 209838, "total_cost": 0.09045840000000001}, "unique_endpoints": {"200": ["POST /elements/area"], "300": [], "400": ["POST /elements/area"], "500": 0}, "total_true_result": 3, "total_false_result": 2}
