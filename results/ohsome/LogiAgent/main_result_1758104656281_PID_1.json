The payload should include:\n        - A valid bounding box (bbox) defining a geographic rectangular area.\n        - A circle (bcircle) within the bounding box, with coordinates and radius.\n        - A polygon (bpoly) overlapping partially with the bbox.\n      - Include filtering parameters that specify several OSM element tags (e.g., highway, building) to confirm the API properly handles tag filters combined with multi-boundary grouping.\n    - **Expected Response:** \n      - HTTP 200 OK.\n      - JSON response containing separate count groups keyed by each boundary type with accurate counts of elements within each spatial filter.\n      - Counts correspond correctly to the tags and do not cross-contaminate between boundaries (e.g., counts for the polygon are distinct from those for the circle).\n      - Response schema confirms grouping by boundary type and tag filters.\n\n2. **Title:** Retrieve and Compare Counts After Modifying Boundary Parameters\n    - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/count/groupBy/boundary\n    - **Description:** \n      - Using the same tags from step 1, send a new request where the polygon boundary (bpoly) is altered to a non-overlapping area outside the initial bounding box and circle.\n      - Validate that counts for the modified polygon boundary reduce or change significantly while bbox and circle counts remain similar.\n      - This tests if the API properly recalculates counts on boundary changes and does not cache or mix results from previous requests.\n    - **Expected Response:** \n      - HTTP 200 OK.\n      - JSON response showing changed counts specifically for the updated polygon area.\n      - Counts for unchanged bbox and circle boundaries remain consistent with step 1 response, confirming boundary-specific aggregation.\n\n3. **Title:** Request Counts with Partial and Malformed Boundary Filters to Test Input Validation and Error Handling\n    - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/count/groupBy/boundary\n    - **Description:** \n      - Try submitting requests with incomplete or malformed boundaries, such as:\n        - A bbox missing some required coordinates.\n        - A polygon with invalid geometry (e.g., self-intersecting).\n        - A bcircle missing radius or having negative radius.\n      - Include valid tags to ensure the error is due only to boundary issues.\n      - The test checks if the API robustly detects input errors and returns informative error messages without partial or incorrect results.\n    - **Expected Response:** \n      - HTTP 400 Bad Request with detailed error messages specifying the malformed boundary parameters.\n      - No partial or inconsistent counts returned.\n      - API does not crash or return HTTP 500 errors.\n\n4. **Title:** Concurrent Requests with Overlapping Boundaries to Detect Race Conditions or Data Consistency Issues\n    - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/count/groupBy/boundary\n    - **Description:** \n      - Simultaneously send multiple requests with slightly overlapping bbox, bcircle, and bpoly boundaries, all filtering for the same set of tags.\n      - Include requests that randomly switch tag filters between sets (e.g., highway only, building only, combined).\n      - The goal is to ensure that concurrent processing does not cause counts to bleed between requests or create inconsistent aggregation results.\n    - **Expected Response:** \n      - Each concurrent request responds with accurate counts consistent with the spatial filters and tag sets.\n      - No request responses reflect data from others.\n      - All responses are HTTP 200 OK, and latency remains acceptable under concurrency stress.\n\n5. **Title:** Verify Idempotency and State Persistence Across Repeated Calls with Identical Payloads\n    - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/count/groupBy/boundary\n    - **Description:** \n      - Repeatedly submit exactly the same request (with a fixed combination of boundaries and tags) multiple times in sequence.\n      - Confirm that each response returns consistent counts, demonstrating that no hidden state mutation or side effect occurs in the data aggregation.\n      - Additionally, test with minor variations in tag letter casing to verify consistent normalization and grouping.\n    - **Expected Response:** \n      - All requests return identical count numbers within acceptable tolerance for dynamic data (e.g., zero or minimal variation).\n      - HTTP 200 OK responses.\n      - Tags are treated case-insensitively, producing matching counts for casing variants.\n      - No increments or decrements in counts indicating erroneous state changes.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis comprehensive scenario exercises the POST /elements/count/groupBy/boundary API through varied, logically connected steps mixing multiple boundary types, tag filters, input validation, concurrency, and idempotency testing. It aims to reveal defects in input handling, aggregation accuracy per boundary, concurrency issues, state consistency over repeated calls, and robustness to malformed inputs, ensuring reliable and predictable spatial grouping of element counts in complex real-world use cases.", "usage": {"total_tokens": 55806, "total_cost": 0.026942400000000005}, "unique_endpoints": {"200": ["POST /elements/count"], "300": [], "400": ["POST /elements/count"], "500": 0}, "total_true_result": 1, "total_false_result": 1}
