Any significant inconsistency without state change or failure to update after simulated change should be flagged.\n\n5. **Title:** Boundary Condition Test: Request with Unexpected Query Parameters  \n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /users/count/density?extraParam=unexpected  \n   - **Description:** Call the endpoint with an additional, unsupported query parameter to verify that the API ignores unexpected inputs gracefully, without failing or returning incorrect data.  \n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with the standard density response ignoring the extraneous parameter, or HTTP 400 Bad Request with descriptive error if strict parameter validation is enforced.\n\n6. **Title:** Malformed Request: Invalid Headers and Content-Type Handling on GET Method  \n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /users/count/density  \n   - **Description:** Send a GET request with invalid or inappropriate headers such as an unsupported content-type (e.g., application/xml) to observe whether the API validates headers properly and returns meaningful error messages without server-side exceptions.  \n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 400 Bad Request or HTTP 415 Unsupported Media Type indicating improper content-type headers, with clear error explanation.\n\n7. **Title:** Sequence Consistency Check: Switching Between Correct GET and Incorrect POST Requests  \n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /users/count/density and POST /users/count/density alternately  \n   - **Description:** Alternate between sending valid GET requests and invalid POST requests repeatedly (e.g., 3 times each) to verify the server maintains stable state, returns consistent data on GET, and proper error handlings on POST without crashes or state corruption.  \n   - **Expected Response:** All GET requests return HTTP 200 OK with valid density data; all POST requests return appropriate error codes like 405 or 400 consistently.\n\n8. **Title:** Stress Test with High-Frequency GET Requests to Detect Rate Limiting or Resource Exhaustion  \n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /users/count/density  \n   - **Description:** Rapidly send a high volume of GET requests (e.g., 100 requests within a short timeframe) to evaluate server response behavior under load, testing for potential rate limiting, throttling, or degradation in response correctness.  \n   - **Expected Response:** Majority of responses are HTTP 200 OK with correct density data; if rate limiting is enforced, receive HTTP 429 Too Many Requests with proper retry headers; no server crashes or data corruption should occur.\n\nSummary:  \nThis scenario comprehensively examines the GET /users/count/density endpoint's correctness, robustness, concurrency handling, error management with unsupported methods and malformed requests, behavior under load, and its ability to maintain consistent and accurate data retrieval across varied and challenging interaction patterns. This workflow helps identify issues related to method validation, data consistency, server stability, input tolerance, and API adherence to RESTful principles.", "usage": {"total_tokens": 148651, "total_cost": 0.06435160000000001}, "unique_endpoints": {"200": [], "300": [], "400": ["POST /users/count", "GET /users/count"], "500": 0}, "total_true_result": 1, "total_false_result": 2}
