The response structure should be consistent and include all expected element types (e.g., node, way, relation).\n\n2. **Title:** Count Elements Grouped by Type with Invalid or Unexpected Filter Parameters\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/count/groupBy/type\n   - **Description:** Send a request with an invalid or unexpected filter parameter (for example, a non-existent attribute or malformed polygon boundary) to test input validation and error handling.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 400 Bad Request with a detailed error message indicating invalid input parameters without any server-side crash. The API should gracefully reject invalid filters without affecting previous baseline data.\n\n3. **Title:** Count Elements Grouped by Type with Valid Complex Polygon Boundary Filtering\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/count/groupBy/type\n   - **Description:** Submit a request with a complex polygon boundary filter that overlaps multiple known regions to verify that counts accurately reflect only elements inside this specific geographic area.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with a JSON response containing updated element counts within the filtered polygon. Counts should be consistent with known element distributions and smaller or equal to baseline counts.\n\n4. **Title:** Repeated Count Requests with Slightly Modified Polygon Boundaries to Check Consistency and State Management\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/count/groupBy/type (multiple calls)\n   - **Description:** Make multiple sequential calls with polygons that change slightly in size and shape (nested or overlapping areas) to test if counts change consistently with boundary updates and no stale or cached data issues occur.\n   - **Expected Response:** Each response returns HTTP 200 OK with counts varying logically in relation to polygon changes (counts increase or decrease predictably). No anomalies such as counts increasing beyond the baseline total or inconsistencies across calls.\n\n5. **Title:** Concurrency Stress Test with Multiple Simultaneous Count Requests Using Diverse Filters\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/count/groupBy/type (concurrent)\n   - **Description:** Perform a burst of concurrent POST requests with varying valid polygon boundaries and filters to test concurrency handling, potential race conditions, and consistency in responses under load.\n   - **Expected Response:** All concurrent requests respond with HTTP 200 OK and correctly computed counts. No errors, timeouts, or data inconsistencies such as duplicated or missing counts occur.\n\n6. **Title:** Idempotency and Stability Check with Repeated Identical Requests\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/count/groupBy/type\n   - **Description:** Repeat the exact same request multiple times to ensure the API returns the same results, confirming no side effects or data state changes occur on repeated identical requests.\n   - **Expected Response:** Identical JSON count data and HTTP 200 OK status on all repeated requests, confirming API idempotency in count retrieval.\n\n7. **Title:** Post-Invalid-Input Recovery Check\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/count/groupBy/type\n   - **Description:** After submitting several invalid or malformed requests, send a correct request with no filters or a basic valid filter to verify if the API recovers gracefully without persisting error state or data corruption.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with valid count data consistent with initial baseline or latest expected state. No error carryover from previous invalid requests.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis complex test scenario rigorously exercises POST /elements/count/groupBy/type through an extended interaction path that begins with baseline data retrieval, includes invalid input handling, complex and dynamic polygon-based filtering, concurrency stress, idempotency checks, and post-error recovery validation. The sequence aims to uncover deeper flaws involving input validation, data consistency across changing filters, concurrency robustness, state management after failures, and proper boundary-based spatial aggregation of element counts by type.", "usage": {"total_tokens": 50202, "total_cost": 0.0234984}, "unique_endpoints": {"200": [], "300": [], "400": ["POST /elements/count"], "500": 0}, "total_true_result": 0, "total_false_result": 1}
