Density values should be non-negative and spatially consistent with the polygon area.\n\n2. **Retrieve Density Using an Overlapping Bounding Box (bbox)**\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/length/density/groupBy/boundary\n   - **Description:** Issue a second request with a bounding box boundary that partially overlaps the previous polygon area.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with aggregated density data reflecting only the bbox area. The density values in the overlapping zone should be consistent or logically proportional when compared with the polygon boundary results from step 1, revealing potential data inconsistency or aggregation defects.\n\n3. **Modify Boundary by Expanding the Original Polygon**\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/length/density/groupBy/boundary\n   - **Description:** Expand the original polygon boundary outward (increase area) and request density data again.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with updated density values. The density should not increase disproportionately given the boundary expansion, verifying that spatial aggregation scales logically and does not double count elements outside the new boundary.\n\n4. **Query with a Circular Boundary (bcircle) Within the Original Polygon**\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/length/density/groupBy/boundary\n   - **Description:** Submit a circular boundary request contained entirely within the original polygon.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with density measurements within that circle. The sum and characteristics of density data inside this circle should logically align with the previously fetched polygon data from step 1, ensuring hierarchical aggregation consistency.\n\n5. **Submit Simultaneous Requests with Mixed Boundaries (Polygon, bbox, and bcircle)**\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/length/density/groupBy/boundary\n   - **Description:** Concurrently send a batch of requests with different boundary types to test concurrency and data consistency under load.\n   - **Expected Response:** All requests respond with HTTP 200 OK and accurate density data. No data leakage or race conditions should occur, and densities should remain consistent regardless of the request load or boundary type variance.\n\n6. **Send Requests with Invalid or Malformed Boundary Parameters**\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/length/density/groupBy/boundary\n   - **Description:** Intentionally submit requests with invalid polygon formats (e.g., self-intersecting polygons, missing coordinates) or impossible boundary definitions (negative bbox dimensions).\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 400 Bad Request errors with clear error messages specifying what input was invalid. The system must gracefully handle bad input without crashing or returning ambiguous errors.\n\n7. **Re-query the Original Polygon Boundary with Additional Filters (if supported) or Empty Parameters**\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/length/density/groupBy/boundary\n   - **Description:** Repeat the original polygon query but omit optional parameters or add filters if supported (e.g., element types). If no filters exist, submit with empty query parameters to test default behavior.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with consistent or filtered density values. The response should match expectations for empty input or reflect logical filtering effects, ensuring no mismatches or unexpected results arise.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis test scenario validates the consistency, correctness, and robustness of the GET /elements/length/density/groupBy/boundary endpoint through multiple types of boundary inputs, dynamic modifications, concurrency handling, and error cases. It uncovers potential defects in spatial aggregation logic, input validation, race condition handling, and response consistency across varied but related queries.", "usage": {"total_tokens": 68867, "total_cost": 0.0322196}, "unique_endpoints": {"200": [], "300": [], "400": ["GET /elements/length"], "500": 0}, "total_true_result": 0, "total_false_result": 2}
