This step establishes a baseline dataset to later verify consistency after boundary and tag filter variations.\n   - **Expected Response:** A 200 OK response containing a structured count map with keys representing combinations of boundary identifiers and tag values, each paired with accurate counts greater than or equal to zero.\n\n2. **Title:** Repeated Count Retrieval with Overlapping Boundaries and Different Tags\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/count/groupBy/boundary/groupBy/tag\n   - **Description:** Perform count queries using multiple overlapping but distinct geographic boundaries (e.g., adjacent or nested polygons) and a different tag (e.g., \"building\") to test the API\u2019s ability to correctly disambiguate counts and handle overlaps. This will test for counting double counting or missed elements under multiple group conditions.\n   - **Expected Response:** A 200 OK response with counts logically consistent with the geographic overlap rules \u2014 no double counting of the same element in overlapping boundaries for the same tag, and accurate tagging classification.\n\n3. **Title:** Count Query with Invalid Boundary Definition\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/count/groupBy/boundary/groupBy/tag\n   - **Description:** Submit a request where the boundary parameter is intentionally malformed (e.g., polygon with self-intersecting edges or invalid geojson). The tag parameter is valid and present. This tests the API\u2019s input validation and error handling.\n   - **Expected Response:** A 400 Bad Request response with a clear, descriptive error message indicating boundary format validation failure; no partial or misleading counts.\n\n4. **Title:** Count Retrieval Using Boundary with No Associated Elements But Valid Tag\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/count/groupBy/boundary/groupBy/tag\n   - **Description:** Query counts for a geographically valid but sparsely populated boundary polygon (e.g., ocean or uninhabited region) with a tag known to be present elsewhere (e.g., \"amenity\"). This verifies how the API handles queries returning zero counts for expected valid inputs.\n   - **Expected Response:** A 200 OK response with counts of zero for all tag subdivisions within the specified boundary \u2014 no erroneous or non-existent data returned.\n\n5. **Title:** Compare Counts for Identical Boundaries with Different Tags and Confirm Consistency\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/count/groupBy/boundary/groupBy/tag (called twice)\n   - **Description:** Execute two calls back-to-back using the exact same boundary parameters but differing only by tag filters (e.g., first \"highway\", then \"waterway\"). Compare the results to confirm that counts reflect only elements tagged accordingly without bleeding across tags or changing unexpectedly.\n   - **Expected Response:** Sequential 200 OK responses, each returning stable and non-overlapping counts for elements grouped by the specified tag within the same boundary, confirming reliable tag grouping isolation and data consistency.\n\n6. **Title:** Cross-Validation of Group-By Outputs by Aggregating Tag Counts Locally and Remotely Within a Boundary\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/count/groupBy/boundary/groupBy/tag\n   - **Description:** Perform two queries for the same boundary\u2014one with multiple tags requested simultaneously (if supported), and others separately for each tag. Sum the counts from separate tag queries and compare to the multi-tag query. This assures consistent aggregation independent of query granularity.\n   - **Expected Response:** All queries return 200 OK. The sum of counts from single-tag queries exactly matches the total counts grouped by multiple tags together without discrepancies or data loss.\n\n7. **Title:** Stress Test by Simulating Rapid Concurrent Requests with Varying Boundaries and Tags\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/count/groupBy/boundary/groupBy/tag\n   - **Description:** Simulate multiple simultaneous requests (e.g., 50+) with diverse valid boundaries and tags to test concurrency handling, consistent count responses, and server stability under load.\n   - **Expected Response:** Majority (ideally all) calls succeed with 200 OK and accurate counts. No intermittent failures, corrupted outputs, or timeouts should occur, indicating robust concurrency management.\n\n8. **Title:** Post-Stress Consistency Check to Validate No State or Cache Drift After Load\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/count/groupBy/boundary/groupBy/tag\n   - **Description:** After the stress test, perform a final count retrieval for a previously used boundary and tag combination to confirm response consistency and verify no cache corruption or transient state effects.\n   - **Expected Response:** Returns 200 OK with counts consistent with the initial baseline retrieval (step 1), showing the system maintains correctness and stability after high loads.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis comprehensive test scenario sequence mixes requests to the GET /elements/count/groupBy/boundary/groupBy/tag endpoint using varied geographic boundaries and tags to uncover defects in input validation, overlapping boundary handling, count consistency, concurrency robustness, and caching effects. It progressively challenges the API with invalid inputs, low-data regions, repeated and multi-tag queries, concurrency stress, and post-load consistency checks to reveal subtle bugs in data grouping logic, state management, and error reporting.", "usage": {"total_tokens": 74767, "total_cost": 0.0344164}, "unique_endpoints": {"200": [], "300": [], "400": ["GET /elements/count"], "500": 0}, "total_true_result": 0, "total_false_result": 2}
