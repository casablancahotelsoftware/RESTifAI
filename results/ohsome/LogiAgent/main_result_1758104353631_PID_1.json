This initial request establishes a baseline density distribution grouped by both the geographic boundary and specific tags such as 'highway' or 'building'.\n    - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with a JSON body containing density values for each combination of boundary segments and tags. The response should accurately reflect spatial aggregation within the defined polygon and tag filters without any missing or zero values.\n\n2. **Title:** Repeat Density Query with Slightly Modified Polygon Boundary to Validate Spatial Updates\n    - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/length/density/groupBy/boundary/groupBy/tag\n    - **Description:** Use a similar polygon boundary shifted slightly or resized to test if the API correctly recalculates results based on boundary geometry changes. The tag parameters remain the same to ensure consistent grouping.\n    - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with a JSON reflecting updated density metrics corresponding exactly to the new boundary. Changes should be consistent with the spatial difference; no caching of stale data, and all elements properly attributed within adjusted boundaries.\n\n3. **Title:** Submit Request with Overlapping Tags to Test Grouping and Aggregation Logic\n    - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/length/density/groupBy/boundary/groupBy/tag\n    - **Description:** Provide a polygon boundary and a set of overlapping or semantically related tags (e.g., 'residential', 'building', 'house') to verify the API handles multiple tag groupings without data duplication or aggregation errors.\n    - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with distinct, non-overlapping density values for each tag group within the given boundary, ensuring proper de-duplication logic and accurate grouping are applied at the tag level.\n\n4. **Title:** Validate Error Handling with Missing Boundary Parameter\n    - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/length/density/groupBy/boundary/groupBy/tag\n    - **Description:** Submit a request that omits or provides an empty boundary parameter but includes valid tags to verify the API\u2019s input validation and error response correctness.\n    - **Expected Response:** HTTP 400 Bad Request with a meaningful error message indicating the absence of mandatory boundary parameter, without any partial processing or server errors.\n\n5. **Title:** Concurrency and Consistency Check via Simultaneous Requests with Identical Parameters\n    - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/length/density/groupBy/boundary/groupBy/tag (multiple concurrent calls)\n    - **Description:** Send multiple concurrent POST requests with identical polygon and tag parameters to test if responses remain consistent under load and no race conditions lead to inconsistent or corrupted aggregation data.\n    - **Expected Response:** Each response should be HTTP 200 OK with identical density groupings. No data mismatches, partial results, or timeouts should occur, demonstrating thread safety and consistent backend state management.\n\n6. **Title:** Submit Complex Polygon Boundary with Nested Boundaries and Verify Aggregation Correctness\n    - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/length/density/groupBy/boundary/groupBy/tag\n    - **Description:** Use a polygon boundary that contains nested boundaries (e.g., a polygon with holes or enclaves) along with tags to verify if the API correctly excludes inner boundary areas and aggregates densities only within specified outer boundaries.\n    - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with density groupings corresponding only to the outer polygon minus the nested holes. This ensures spatial processing correctly handles complex polygon topologies and returns accurate, non-inflated densities.\n\n7. **Title:** Submit Malformed Polygon Data to Test Robustness of Input Validation\n    - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/length/density/groupBy/boundary/groupBy/tag\n    - **Description:** Craft a request with syntactically invalid polygon coordinates (e.g., non-closed polygon, improper coordinate format) alongside valid tags to check API\u2019s resilience and the quality of error feedback.\n    - **Expected Response:** HTTP 400 Bad Request indicating invalid polygon boundary input, with clear error messages preventing processing and no server exceptions.\n\nSummary:  \nThis multi-step scenario rigorously tests the POST /elements/length/density/groupBy/boundary/groupBy/tag endpoint for correct functionality across typical use cases and edge cases. It includes verifying correct aggregation under boundary changes, handling multiple and overlapping tags without duplication, enforcing mandatory boundary input, ensuring concurrency consistency, correctly managing nested polygon geometries, and robustly validating malformed spatial inputs. This comprehensive test uncovers potential issues in spatial aggregation logic, input validation, race conditions, and error handling that were not addressed in previously generated scenarios.", "usage": {"total_tokens": 91427, "total_cost": 0.041276}, "unique_endpoints": {"200": ["POST /elements/length"], "300": [], "400": [], "500": 0}, "total_true_result": 0, "total_false_result": 2}
