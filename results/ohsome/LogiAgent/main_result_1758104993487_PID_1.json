Expect the system to return counts for each user type accurately within that boundary.  \n     - Step 2: Repeat the request with a slightly expanded polygon boundary that overlaps and extends beyond the initial area. The counts for user types should increase correspondingly or remain consistent for overlapping areas.   \n     - Step 3: Submit a request with a polygon boundary that is entirely outside any known user data areas, expecting counts to return zero for all user types.  \n     - Step 4: Submit simultaneous requests (concurrent invocations) with the first and second polygon boundaries to verify concurrency handling and consistent results across overlapping spatial queries.  \n   - **Expected Responses:**  \n     - Step 1 & 2: HTTP 200 OK with a JSON object mapping each user type to an integer count, reflecting the expected increase or consistent aggregation within polygon boundaries.  \n     - Step 3: HTTP 200 OK with zero counts for all user types, confirming correct handling of empty spatial areas.  \n     - Step 4: Both concurrent responses return consistent, accurate counts matching previous individual calls, with no race conditions or data inconsistency.  \n\n2. **Title:** Input Validation and Error Handling with Invalid and Missing Boundary Parameters  \n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /users/count/groupBy/type  \n   - **Description:**  \n     - Step 1: Send a request missing the required polygon boundary parameters to confirm enforcement of mandatory inputs.  \n     - Step 2: Send a request with malformed polygon coordinates (e.g., invalid GeoJSON or non-numeric values) to test input validation robustness.  \n     - Step 3: Send a request with an unsupported boundary type parameter (e.g., a mix of bounding box and polygon) to test parameter combination rules and error handling.  \n   - **Expected Responses:**  \n     - Step 1: HTTP 400 Bad Request with an explicit error message indicating missing required boundary filters.  \n     - Step 2: HTTP 400 Bad Request with clear validation error describing malformed spatial input.  \n     - Step 3: HTTP 400 Bad Request specifying unsupported parameter combinations, ensuring clients receive helpful feedback for correction.  \n\n3. **Title:** Impact of Repeated and Overlapping Calls on Data Consistency and Performance  \n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /users/count/groupBy/type  \n   - **Description:**  \n     - Step 1: Issue multiple identical requests consecutively with a fixed polygon boundary to test idempotency and caching behavior. Confirm that results remain identical and consistent.  \n     - Step 2: Issue overlapping polygon boundary requests repeatedly to observe if counts remain logically consistent given overlapping user data distributions.  \n     - Step 3: Simultaneously send rapid repeated calls with different polygon sizes to stress test concurrency and ensure no cross-request state leakage or inconsistent aggregations occur.  \n   - **Expected Responses:**  \n     - Step 1: All responses return identical counts by user type, with no discrepancies or side effects from repeated calls.  \n     - Step 2: Overlapping polygon requests return counts that reflect appropriate overlaps without duplication or omission.  \n     - Step 3: Responses for rapid, concurrent varied polygon requests maintain accuracy, with no errors or inconsistent results seen.  \n\n4. **Title:** Consistency Check Between Polygon vs. Equivalent Bounding Box Requests  \n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /users/count/groupBy/type  \n   - **Description:**  \n     - Step 1: Define a polygon boundary representing an area roughly comparable to a bounding box covering the same geographic region.  \n     - Step 2: Issue one request with the polygon boundary and a second request with the equivalent bounding box boundary specification.  \n     - Step 3: Compare the returned grouped user counts for both requests to verify that counts are consistent or have logically explainable differences due to boundary shape.  \n   - **Expected Responses:**  \n     - Both requests should return HTTP 200 OK.  \n     - User counts grouped by type should be nearly identical or vary only because of subtle differences in boundary inclusion/exclusion.  \n     - Any discrepancies must be logically justifiable given the spatial definitions, revealing accurate spatial filtering behavior.  \n\n**Summary:**  \nThis comprehensive test scenario combines multiple complex interactions with the POST /users/count/groupBy/type endpoint. It validates functional correctness across spatial boundaries, input validation, concurrency robustness, idempotency, and logical consistency between different boundary specifications. The scenario aims to detect subtle defects affecting aggregation accuracy, input handling, error messaging, and performance under load, enabling a reliable and robust spatial user count grouping service.", "usage": {"total_tokens": 35832, "total_cost": 0.017497200000000004}, "unique_endpoints": {"200": [], "300": [], "400": ["POST /users/count"], "500": 0}, "total_true_result": 0, "total_false_result": 0}
