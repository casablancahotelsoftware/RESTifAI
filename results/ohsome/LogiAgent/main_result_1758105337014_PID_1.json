Data should be internally consistent (densities should be non-negative numbers) and represent the current global dataset.\n\n2. **Title:** Simulate Data Update via External Process and Verify Density Consistency\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/count/density/groupBy/type\n   - **Description:** After performing an assumed external update of OSM elements data (not via API but simulating new data ingestion), invoke the density count endpoint again to verify if density values have been updated properly or remain consistent if no new data was ingested.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK, with densities reflecting updated or consistent counts compared to the previous call. Any unexpected large deviations or missing types would indicate data synchronization issues or stale caches.\n\n3. **Title:** Inject Invalid Parameter in Density Request and Validate Error Handling\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/count/density/groupBy/type\n   - **Description:** Malform the request by adding an unsupported query parameter or invalid data type (e.g., densityLevel=high as an unrecognized parameter) to test the API\u2019s robustness to unexpected inputs.\n   - **Expected Response:** The API should either ignoring unknown parameters gracefully and return HTTP 200 with standard count response, or it should reject the request with an HTTP 400 Bad Request and informative error message describing the invalid parameter. No server error (5xx) or unexpected behavior is acceptable.\n\n4. **Title:** Concurrent Requests to Verify Consistent Results Under Load\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/count/density/groupBy/type\n   - **Description:** Fire multiple (e.g., 10 to 20) concurrent GET requests to this endpoint to test system stability and consistent density counts returned under simultaneous load.\n   - **Expected Response:** Each concurrent response should return HTTP 200 OK with identical or nearly identical density counts, verifying no race conditions, stale data, or inconsistent states occur during concurrent access.\n\n5. **Title:** Verify Idempotency and Cache Consistency by Repeated Calls\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/count/density/groupBy/type\n   - **Description:** Repeat the same GET request multiple times sequentially and verify that results remain stable and unchanged, indicating that the API implements idempotency correctly and that no unintended state changes or inconsistencies result from multiple fetches.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK responses each time with the same density groupings and counts, confirming stable, read-only behavior of this API endpoint over repeated access.\n\n6. **Title:** Cross-check Data Consistency with Related Aggregation APIs (If Any Exist)\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/count/density/groupBy/type (with specific filters if applicable)\n   - **Description:** If supported, add valid but selective filters (such as restricting to a spatial subset or certain tags) and compare aggregated densities from this endpoint to those from other element-related endpoints (not provided here, so this step checks just internal consistency within /elements/count/density/groupBy/type across filtered versus unfiltered calls).\n   - **Expected Response:** Filtered density counts should logically be less than or equal to the unfiltered totals and must have consistent type groupings. Any inconsistencies may indicate aggregation or filtering defects.\n\n7. **Title:** Boundary or Tag Filtering Injection via Query (to Confirm Filter Rejection or Ignoring)\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/count/density/groupBy/type\n   - **Description:** Attempt to pass typical filter parameters known from other related APIs (e.g., bboxes, tags) in the query string to validate if this endpoint accepts or ignores such filters, testing adherence to input specification and graceful handling.\n   - **Expected Response:** Since the API description does not mention filter parameters, the API should either ignore them and return unfiltered counts or reject with a clear informative error (HTTP 400). Unexpected behavior or ignoring critical filters would suggest a flaw in input validation or API contract clarity.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis multi-step scenario rigorously tests the GET /elements/count/density/groupBy/type endpoint for baseline retrieval, robustness against invalid inputs, stability under concurrency, idempotency, and input validation for unexpected or unsupported filters. It helps identify issues related to data consistency, error handling, concurrency safety, and API contract adherence, enabling more robust system operations and uncovering subtle defects that simpler single-request tests might miss.", "usage": {"total_tokens": 123155, "total_cost": 0.053918}, "unique_endpoints": {"200": [], "300": [], "400": ["GET /elements/count"], "500": 0}, "total_true_result": 0, "total_false_result": 4}
