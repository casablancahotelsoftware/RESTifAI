This tests the basic expected functional behavior to ensure the API correctly calculates and returns density values for reasonable input areas.  \n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with a JSON payload containing the calculated user density as a numerical value greater than zero, representing users per square kilometer in the requested region.\n\n2. **Title:** Repeated Density Retrieval to Check Consistency and Caching Effects  \n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /users/count/density  \n   - **Description:** Immediately after the first retrieval, issue several repeated GET requests with the same parameters to test if the system returns consistent results without fluctuations and verify if caching or stateful storage impacts response consistency.  \n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with identical user density values across all repeated calls. Any significant variance in densities may indicate state management or caching issues.\n\n3. **Title:** Request Density for a Zero-Area or Extremely Small Area Polygon  \n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /users/count/density  \n   - **Description:** Trigger the API with parameters defining an area of zero size (e.g., a point instead of polygon or an empty boundary) or an extremely tiny polygon to test robustness and error handling for edge-case spatial inputs where area is zero or near-zero.  \n   - **Expected Response:** A graceful response either returning density as zero or an informative HTTP 400 Bad Request error specifying invalid or too-small area parameters. The system should not crash or return meaningless density values (such as Infinity).\n\n4. **Title:** Request Density with Malformed or Unsupported Geographical Parameters  \n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /users/count/density  \n   - **Description:** Send requests with deliberately malformed bounding parameters (e.g., invalid coordinates, incorrect parameter names, or unsupported spatial formats) to check input validation and error response handling.  \n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 400 Bad Request with a meaningful error message indicating parameter validation failure without returning user density data.\n\n5. **Title:** Sequential Calls with Overlapping but Different Boundaries to Test Data Consistency  \n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /users/count/density  \n   - **Description:** Make sequential calls with slightly overlapping regions to verify if the density values are consistent with the expected spatial overlap logic. For example, if region B overlaps partially with previously queried region A, the density for B should logically reflect its own area-user ratio independently.  \n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with density values logically consistent relative to the requested areas. No contradictory or illogical fluctuations in user density should be observed that violate spatial overlaps.\n\n6. **Title:** Simulate Concurrent Requests for Density to Assess System Concurrency Handling  \n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /users/count/density  \n   - **Description:** Simulate multiple concurrent GET requests with different valid area inputs to evaluate if the system can handle concurrency without returning errors, deadlocks, or stale data.  \n   - **Expected Response:** All concurrent calls should return HTTP 200 OK independently with appropriate density values matching their respective regions. No race conditions or server overload errors (5xx) should occur.\n\n7. **Title:** Request Density for a Very Large Geographic Area Crossing Multiple Regions  \n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /users/count/density  \n   - **Description:** Submit a request for a very large bounding box that spans multiple administrative and geographic regions to verify API scalability and correct aggregation behavior over large spatial extents.  \n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with a single density value representing the total user count divided by the total area. The value should be reasonable (e.g., density should be lower than or equal to densities from smaller subregions).\n\n8. **Title:** Request Density without Required Parameters or with Empty Input  \n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /users/count/density  \n   - **Description:** Issue a call omitting required parameters (such as the polygon or area definition if required) or pass an empty payload to evaluate the system\u2019s handling of missing or empty inputs.  \n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 400 Bad Request or HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity with a clear error message indicating missing or invalid parameters.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis test scenario comprehensively exercises the GET /users/count/density endpoint covering basic functionality, input validation, edge cases (zero or extremely small areas), data consistency with overlapping queries, concurrency robustness, large-scale aggregation, and error handling for malformed or missing inputs. It focuses on uncovering potential defects in state management, spatial calculation correctness, input sanitation, concurrency control, and response stability, ensuring the user density API operates reliably under diverse and realistic usage conditions.", "usage": {"total_tokens": 90360, "total_cost": 0.04072799999999999}, "unique_endpoints": {"200": [], "300": [], "400": ["POST /users/count", "GET /users/count"], "500": 0}, "total_true_result": 0, "total_false_result": 2}
