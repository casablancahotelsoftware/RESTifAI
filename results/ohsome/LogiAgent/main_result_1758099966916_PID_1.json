Verify that the response contains counts correctly aggregated by valid types (e.g., node, way, relation).\n   - **Expected Response:** A 200 OK response with a JSON payload containing density data grouped by element types. The grouping keys should correspond to legitimate OSM types with accurate counts in each group.\n\n2. **Title:** Submit Grouping Request with Missing or Malformed Type Field\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/count/density/groupBy/type\n   - **Description:** Send a request missing the required 'type' grouping field or containing an incorrectly formatted grouping parameter (e.g., an empty string or number instead of a string type).\n   - **Expected Response:** A 400 Bad Request error indicating validation failure on missing or malformed grouping parameters. The error message should clearly state the issue with the grouping field for client correction.\n\n3. **Title:** Concurrent Requests with Overlapping GroupBy Type Parameters to Validate Consistency\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/count/density/groupBy/type (sent concurrently)\n   - **Description:** Trigger multiple concurrent requests with slightly different but overlapping grouping parameters to check if the API maintains consistent and isolated density calculations without race conditions or data leakage. For instance, one request groups fully by 'type' while another adds filtering parameters or limits (if supported).\n   - **Expected Response:** All concurrent calls respond with consistent and correct grouping results without data mix-up or server errors (e.g., 500 or 503). Data integrity should be maintained with proper error-free isolation.\n\n4. **Title:** Repeated Request with Identical GroupBy Type to Test Caching and Idempotency\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/count/density/groupBy/type\n   - **Description:** Repeat an identical request multiple times to verify if the service correctly handles idempotency, possibly using caching to optimize performance, without returning stale or inconsistent data.\n   - **Expected Response:** Each response should return the same density grouping results with HTTP 200 status. There should be no indication of expired or outdated counts. Performance improvement on repeats is a positive sign, but correctness is the priority.\n\n5. **Title:** Boundary Parameter Injection with GroupBy Type to Check Input Validation Synergy\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/count/density/groupBy/type (with an unsupported or malformed boundary parameter)\n   - **Description:** Intentionally include a boundary parameter or spatial filter that the endpoint does not officially support to test if the API responds gracefully when additional irrelevant parameters are injected alongside the groupBy type request.\n   - **Expected Response:** The API should either ignore the unsupported boundary parameter and proceed or respond with a validation error explaining parameter misuse. No unexpected server errors or crashes should occur.\n\n6. **Title:** High Load Testing with Large Volume GroupBy Type Requests to Detect Performance Bottlenecks\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/count/density/groupBy/type repeatedly in rapid succession or batch mode\n   - **Description:** Conduct a load test by sending a high volume of requests to the groupBy type endpoint successively or in parallel to assess performance degradation, throttling, or failures under pressure.\n   - **Expected Response:** The API should handle the high load gracefully with successful 200 responses or proper rate limiting / throttling error codes like 429 Too Many Requests without breakdown or inconsistent data.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis test scenario rigorously investigates the POST /elements/count/density/groupBy/type endpoint by covering valid and invalid parameter handling, concurrency and consistency under simultaneous requests, idempotency through repeated calls, input validation against parameter injection, and stability under high-load conditions. These steps aim to reveal defects in grouping logic, input validation robustness, request isolation, error handling, caching behavior, and scalability critical to reliable density aggregations of OSM elements grouped by type.", "usage": {"total_tokens": 57863, "total_cost": 0.0267812}, "unique_endpoints": {"200": [], "300": [], "400": ["POST /elements/count"], "500": 0}, "total_true_result": 0, "total_false_result": 1}
