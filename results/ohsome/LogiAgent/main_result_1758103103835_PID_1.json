{"all_cnt": 0, "all_request_sequence": [], "right_results": [], "wrong_results": [], "test_scenario_response_message": "1. **Title:** Calculate Density of OSM Elements Within a Valid Polygon Boundary\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/length/density\n   - **Description:** Submit a well-formed polygon boundary representing a known geographical area to calculate the density of OSM elements (length/area) within that area. This step validates that the API correctly processes spatial input and returns density data conforming to expected calculations.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with a JSON body containing a numerical density value reflecting the length of elements divided by the polygon\u2019s area in square kilometers. Data should be logically accurate given known area size.\n\n2. **Title:** Recalculate Density with Slightly Modified Boundary and Verify Density Update\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/length/density\n   - **Description:** Submit a polygon boundary slightly expanded or shifted compared to the previous boundary to test if the density value changes accordingly, reflecting the altered boundary area and included elements.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with density data differing logically from the previous response, consistent with expected element length changes proportional to the boundary modification. Confirm no stale or cached data is returned.\n\n3. **Title:** Submit Invalid Polygon Data to Validate Input Validation and Error Handling\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/length/density\n   - **Description:** Attempt a request with an invalid polygon format (e.g., intersecting edges, missing coordinates, or malformed JSON) to verify that the API detects the input error and responds appropriately.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 400 Bad Request with a clear, descriptive error message indicating invalid polygon input. No density calculation should be performed.\n\n4. **Title:** Test Density Calculation with an Empty Polygon (Zero Area)\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/length/density\n   - **Description:** Submit a polygon with area effectively zero (all points the same or a line) to check how the service handles edge cases where area calculation might yield zero and division could be undefined.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 400 or HTTP 422 response indicating invalid polygon area input or a meaningful error explaining that density calculation cannot be performed on zero-area boundaries.\n\n5. **Title:** Repeated Calls with Identical Boundaries to Test Idempotency and Caching Behavior\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/length/density\n   - **Description:** Issue multiple identical requests using the same polygon boundary to verify consistent density values and confirm that repeated queries do not cause state inconsistencies or unexpected errors.\n   - **Expected Response:** Consecutive HTTP 200 OK responses each returning the same density value. Response times should be consistent or show expected improvements if caching is enabled. No errors or variations in results.\n\n6. **Title:** Simulate Concurrent Requests with Different Boundaries to Test Concurrency and Isolation\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/length/density (multiple parallel calls)\n   - **Description:** Simultaneously send multiple POST requests with different valid polygon boundaries to test API\u2019s concurrency handling, ensuring no cross-request contamination or race conditions occur.\n   - **Expected Response:** All requests return HTTP 200 OK with accurate and independent density values matching their respective boundaries. No race-condition effects or corrupted data responses observed.\n\n7. **Title:** Verify Response Structure and Field Types for Various Valid Requests\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/length/density\n   - **Description:** Submit valid polygon boundaries and validate the response JSON structure strictly, verifying fields such as density value type (number), presence of metadata, and absence of unexpected or extraneous fields.\n   - **Expected Response:** Responses contain the density value as a number, with consistent and documented field names and no null or missing fields. No unexpected data present.\n\n8. **Title:** Submit Polygon Boundary Containing Special Characters in Coordinates to Test Robustness\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/length/density\n   - **Description:** Send a polygon boundary JSON that includes coordinate values encoded with Unicode or special characters in metadata or property names (if applicable) to test input sanitation and parsing robustness.\n   - **Expected Response:** Either HTTP 200 OK with valid density if special characters are safely ignored or handled, or HTTP 400 Bad Request with clear error if such characters violate input constraints. No unexpected crashes or undefined behavior.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis comprehensive scenario tests the POST /elements/length/density endpoint\u2019s ability to handle valid, invalid, edge-case, and concurrent polygon inputs. It examines input validation, error handling, idempotency, concurrency safety, data consistency, and response correctness, collectively revealing potential defects in state management, boundary parsing, and computational logic for OSM element density calculations.", "usage": {"total_tokens": 35051, "total_cost": 0.0171344}, "unique_endpoints": {"200": [], "300": [], "400": [], "500": 0}, "total_true_result": 0, "total_false_result": 0}
