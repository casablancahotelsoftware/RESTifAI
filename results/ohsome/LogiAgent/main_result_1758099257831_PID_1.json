Verify response includes density values for multiple expected types (e.g., building, highway, park).\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with JSON payload containing a dictionary/object keyed by element types, each value containing a numeric density figure. The response should include types relevant to the area and no missing or null density values.\n\n2. **Title:** Repeated Density Grouping Call to Verify Idempotency and Consistency\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/area/density/groupBy/type\n   - **Description:** Repeat the exact same request from step 1 multiple times (3 times in sequence) to verify the service returns consistent density grouping results without variation or errors.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK for all calls, identical density values in JSON payload across all responses, confirming the operation is idempotent and state-independent.\n\n3. **Title:** Density Grouping Request with Slightly Modified Area Boundary to Test Sensitivity\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/area/density/groupBy/type\n   - **Description:** Alter the earlier polygon by slightly expanding or contracting the spatial boundary to test if density values reflect the changed dataset. This validates the API properly respects spatial filters.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK, JSON response with density values differing from step 1 as the element counts and area are changed accordingly. Types included should remain consistent.\n\n4. **Title:** Density Grouping with Invalid Area Geometry to Test Input Validation\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/area/density/groupBy/type\n   - **Description:** Submit an invalid polygon geometry (e.g., self-intersecting polygon, corrupted coordinates) to the API to test robust input validation and error handling mechanisms.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 400 Bad Request with a meaningful error message indicating invalid or malformed spatial boundary input. No crash or 500 level errors.\n\n5. **Title:** Concurrent Requests with Overlapping but Distinct Areas for Density Groupings\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/area/density/groupBy/type\n   - **Description:** Fire 5 parallel requests each with different but overlapping polygonal areas to test concurrency performance and correct isolation of spatial filters.\n   - **Expected Response:** All 5 requests return HTTP 200 OK with respective accurate density groupings according to each polygon. Results for intersecting areas differ appropriately without cross-request data contamination.\n\n6. **Title:** Large Polygon Area for Density Grouping to Evaluate Performance and Response Limits\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/area/density/groupBy/type\n   - **Description:** Submit a large polygon covering a vast geographic area (e.g., an entire city or county) to test the API\u2019s capability in processing and aggregating density data at scale.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with a comprehensive density grouping response. Performance should be acceptable (response within reasonable time), densities accurately reflective of the large area, and no truncation or missing data.\n\n7. **Title:** Density Grouping with Missing Required Spatial Parameter to Verify Error Handling\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/area/density/groupBy/type\n   - **Description:** Submit a request without the spatial area parameter or with an empty payload to test if the API correctly identifies and rejects incomplete requests.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 400 Bad Request with clear error messaging indicating the missing area parameter or required spatial input.\n\n8. **Title:** Density Grouping Request with Additional Unexpected Parameters to Test Robustness\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/area/density/groupBy/type\n   - **Description:** Submit a valid spatial polygon along with extra unrelated parameters in the request body to check whether the API ignores extraneous inputs or raises errors.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK if the API ignores extraneous parameters, and returns valid density grouping; alternatively, HTTP 400 if extra parameters are disallowed, but should never cause server errors.\n\n9. **Title:** Cross-compare Density Groupings between Two Different Types of Boundaries\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/area/density/groupBy/type\n   - **Description:** Run two separate density grouping calls: one with a polygonal boundary, another approximating the same spatial region but using a simplified bounding box polygon. Compare densities to check if spatial filtering precision impacts results as expected.\n   - **Expected Response:** Both calls return 200 OK with density groupings that differ slightly due to geometry difference. The bounding box call should generally cover a larger area, resulting in lower or more diluted density values.\n\n10. **Title:** Verify No Residual State Leakage across Requests by Alternating Empty and Valid Polygons\n    - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/area/density/groupBy/type\n    - **Description:** Alternate requests between a valid polygon area and an empty or very small polygon (that contains no elements) in sequence to confirm the API does not leak data or state between calls.\n    - **Expected Response:** Valid polygons return 200 OK with densities; empty or minimal polygons return empty density results or zero densities with 200 OK and no contamination from previous calls.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis scenario thoroughly tests the POST /elements/area/density/groupBy/type endpoint by combining valid and invalid spatial inputs, repeated and concurrent calls, performance under large data requests, validation robustness, and behavior under extraneous parameters. The workflow is designed to reveal defects in input validation, spatial filter handling, concurrency isolation, state management, error reporting, and data consistency, which are crucial for reliable density aggregation operations based on complex spatial boundaries.", "usage": {"total_tokens": 40757, "total_cost": 0.02021}, "unique_endpoints": {"200": [], "300": [], "400": ["POST /elements/area"], "500": 0}, "total_true_result": 0, "total_false_result": 0}
