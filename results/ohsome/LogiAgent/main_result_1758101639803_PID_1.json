Perform the request multiple times with varied spatial filters if supported (e.g., bounding boxes or predefined areas) to check for consistency across results and absence of duplicate or missing data.\n   - **Expected Response:** Successful 200 OK response with a structured JSON object containing a list of element types, each paired with a numeric area value. The sum of all grouped areas should be consistent across repeated queries for the same area and no negative or zero values unless logically valid.\n\n2. **Title:** Consistency Check of Area Values After Application of Implied Filters\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/area/groupBy/type\n   - **Description:** Re-run the area grouping but include query parameters (if any supported by the API or boundary filters if applied through method variations) to filter elements within a smaller geographic boundary or specific tag constraints (simulate through multiple requests if necessary). This step aims to compare the aggregated area sums with the previous broader query to ensure filtering logic correctly reduces or modifies data without residual carry-overs or overlaps.\n   - **Expected Response:** A 200 OK response with grouped area data that logically fits within the smaller boundary or filter applied. The sum of areas must be equal to or less than the total from the previous unrestricted (or larger boundary) request, confirming correct filter application.\n\n3. **Title:** Invalid Boundary Parameter Handling and Error Consistency\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/area/groupBy/type\n   - **Description:** Intentionally invoke the API with malformed or logically invalid boundary parameters (e.g., invalid polygon strings, coordinates out of range, or empty boundary definitions if applicable). Verify the API\u2019s robustness in input validation and error handling.\n   - **Expected Response:** A proper error response, ideally HTTP 400 Bad Request, with clear, descriptive error messages explaining the invalid input. No partial data or crashes should occur.\n\n4. **Title:** Cross-Method Logic Consistency Test via Repeated Groupings and Aggregations\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/area/groupBy/type (multiple calls)\n   - **Description:** Make repeated calls to the endpoint with the same parameters in quick succession to test for state inconsistencies, race conditions, or caching issues that might cause transient discrepancies in reported area data grouped by type.\n   - **Expected Response:** Identical and stable response data across all repeated calls, confirming stable server-side state or caching mechanisms without race condition issues.\n\n5. **Title:** Large Dataset Stress Scenario with Concurrent Requests\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/area/groupBy/type\n   - **Description:** Simultaneously trigger several concurrent requests using large geographic boundaries or complex polygon shapes (if supported) to evaluate the API\u2019s robustness, throttling, rate limiting, and consistent area calculations under load.\n   - **Expected Response:** All requests respond with HTTP 200 and correct grouped area data. Response times remain within acceptable limits and no server errors or partial responses occur.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis test scenario chain thoroughly validates the GET /elements/area/groupBy/type API\u2019s accuracy, input validation, error handling, stability under repeated calls, and concurrent usage. It focuses on detecting defects such as data mismatches between aggregated area sums under different filters, improper error responses on invalid inputs, race conditions or inconsistency in repeated calls, and performance issues under heavy concurrent access.", "usage": {"total_tokens": 81031, "total_cost": 0.0362836}, "unique_endpoints": {"200": [], "300": [], "400": ["GET /elements/area"], "500": 0}, "total_true_result": 0, "total_false_result": 3}
