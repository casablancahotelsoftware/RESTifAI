The goal is to group OSM contributions count density by these mixed boundary types in a single aggregated response.\n   - **Expected Response:** A 200 OK response returning a JSON object that correctly groups contribution densities by each specified boundary type section with no data overlap or duplication. Each group should be distinctly identified and spatially accurate according to the boundaries provided.\n\n2. **Title:** Update Boundary Parameters and Verify Data Consistency\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /contributions/count/density/groupBy/boundary\n   - **Description:** After the initial mixed boundary request, submit a second GET request with a slightly altered polygon boundary that overlaps partially with the original polygon but excludes some areas, combined again with the other boundary types. This tests whether the system properly recalculates density counts dynamically according to input boundaries rather than caching stale results.\n   - **Expected Response:** A 200 OK response with updated contribution density counts, reflecting the new polygon boundary. The densities inside the removed overlapping areas should reduce or disappear, ensuring no stale or cached counts appear erroneously.\n\n3. **Title:** Simulate Rapid Sequential Requests with Conflicting Boundaries\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /contributions/count/density/groupBy/boundary\n   - **Description:** Fire off a series of rapid GET requests (five in approximately 2 seconds) with rapidly changing boundary shapes and sizes, including invalid boundary data (e.g., malformed polygons or impossible circles) amidst valid requests. This scenario stresses error handling and concurrency safety \u2014 ensuring that the system correctly isolates each request and does not leak or mix data between responses.\n   - **Expected Response:** The valid requests return 200 OK with accurate data grouped by boundary. Requests with invalid boundaries receive 400 Bad Request error responses with meaningful error messages describing the boundary input issues. No data bleed or cross-request contamination should occur.\n\n4. **Title:** Verify Response Consistency Across Repeated Identical Boundary Queries\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /contributions/count/density/groupBy/boundary\n   - **Description:** Resend a previously successful mixed-boundary grouping query three times consecutively with no changes to inputs, to check for consistent response data and detect any unexpected state changes or data mutation under repeated identical requests.\n   - **Expected Response:** Each of the three identical requests returns the same, consistent contribution count densities grouped exactly by the original boundaries, with no discrepancies or unexpected variation in density values or group keys.\n\n5. **Title:** Test Boundary Parameter Limitations and Error Handling\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /contributions/count/density/groupBy/boundary\n   - **Description:** Craft boundary requests with unsupported or edge-case boundary values such as extremely large bounding boxes spanning the entire globe, zero-area polygons, or circles with negative radius. This identifies boundary validation issues and system limits on spatial inputs.\n   - **Expected Response:** Requests with invalid boundary geometries or parameters return clear, descriptive 400 Bad Request responses indicating the input errors. Large but valid boundaries return 200 OK with aggregated density data logically consistent with the increased spatial area, without server errors or timeouts.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis scenario sequence rigorously tests the GET /contributions/count/density/groupBy/boundary API by exercising complex spatial boundary queries combining multiple boundary types, verifying dynamic recalculation of densities, ensuring concurrency robustness, validating consistent repeated responses, and robustly handling boundary input errors or edge cases. This multi-step workflow aims to uncover bugs related to spatial data handling, response caching or state leaks, input validation weaknesses, and concurrency management in boundary-based density aggregation logic.", "usage": {"total_tokens": 29365, "total_cost": 0.0146116}, "unique_endpoints": {"200": [], "300": [], "400": ["GET /contributions/count"], "500": 0}, "total_true_result": 0, "total_false_result": 0}
