Include well-formed coordinates and an appropriate Content-Type header (e.g., application/json).\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with a JSON response containing the density value correctly computed as the number of elements divided by the polygon\u2019s total area in square-kilometers. The density should be a positive floating-point number consistent with known OSM data for the selected region.\n\n2. **Title:** Recalculate Density for the Same Polygon to Verify Idempotency and Caching\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/count/density\n   - **Description:** Resubmit the exact same polygon from step 1 to test whether the API returns the same density value and handles repeated calls gracefully, without unintended side effects or performance degradation. This step can reveal issues with caching or state management.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with an identical density value to step 1. The response time should be reasonable, and no errors or inconsistencies should appear.\n\n3. **Title:** Submit Overlapping Polygon to Check Density Computation Consistency\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/count/density\n   - **Description:** Provide a polygon that partially overlaps with the polygon from step 1 but extends beyond it. This tests whether the API correctly recalculates the density taking into account the new, larger area, and how overlapping boundaries affect data aggregation.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with a density value that reflects the larger area. The density can be lower or higher depending on element distribution but must be logically consistent (not zero or negative). Verify that the density is not simply reused from previous responses but recomputed accurately.\n\n4. **Title:** Send Malformed Polygon Data to Test Input Validation\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/count/density\n   - **Description:** Send a malformed request body with incorrect polygon formatting, such as incomplete coordinates, invalid GeoJSON structure, or missing required keys, to verify the API\u2019s input validation and error handling for invalid geo-boundaries.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 400 Bad Request with a clear error message indicating the nature of the polygon format error. The API should not crash, timeout, or return generic errors.\n\n5. **Title:** Send Polygon with Zero or Extremely Small Area to Test Edge Case Handling\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/count/density\n   - **Description:** Provide a polygon that encloses virtually no area or an extremely small area (close to zero square kilometers), to test how the API handles division by zero or near-zero areas in density calculation.\n   - **Expected Response:** Either HTTP 400 Bad Request explaining invalid area or a successful response with a density value calculated without causing divide-by-zero errors (e.g., handling zero area by returning zero or null density). The behavior must be consistent and documented.\n\n6. **Title:** Concurrent Requests with Different Valid Polygons to Test Concurrency and Data Integrity\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/count/density (multiple concurrent calls)\n   - **Description:** Simultaneously submit multiple valid polygon requests representing non-overlapping geographic areas to test concurrency handling, server stability under load, and to detect potential race condition bugs affecting density results.\n   - **Expected Response:** Each concurrent request responds with HTTP 200 OK and correct density for its respective polygon. No inconsistencies, timeouts, or errors such as 500 Internal Server Error are expected. Results should be isolated per request without interference.\n\n7. **Title:** Request Density Calculation with Missing Content-Type Header to Test Request Rejection\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/count/density\n   - **Description:** Send a valid polygon payload but omit the Content-Type header to determine if the API properly rejects requests with missing or unsupported content-type headers.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 415 Unsupported Media Type or HTTP 400 Bad Request with an appropriate error message indicating that Content-Type header is missing or unsupported, and the request is rejected accordingly.\n\n8. **Title:** Request with Extra Unknown Fields in Payload to Test Payload Strictness\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/count/density\n   - **Description:** Include additional random fields in the JSON payload beyond the polygon definition to verify whether the API ignores unknown attributes gracefully or throws validation errors.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with correct density calculation ignoring unknown fields, or HTTP 400 Bad Request with an error specifying unexpected fields. Consistent behavior is expected either way.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis test scenario exercises the POST /elements/count/density API through a logical sequence to verify accurate spatial density calculations across varied polygon inputs, repeated calls, overlapping areas, malformed data, edge conditions, concurrency resilience, and request validation. It aims to uncover defects related to calculation correctness, caching/idempotency, input validation, concurrency effects, error handling, and robustness to malformed or unexpected inputs, thus ensuring the API\u2019s reliability and data consistency under realistic operational scenarios.", "usage": {"total_tokens": 134794, "total_cost": 0.06027880000000001}, "unique_endpoints": {"200": [], "300": [], "400": ["POST /elements/count"], "500": 0}, "total_true_result": 0, "total_false_result": 4}
