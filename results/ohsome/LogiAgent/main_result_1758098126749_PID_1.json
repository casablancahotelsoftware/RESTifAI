The data should be consistent with known user distribution.\n\n2. **Title:** Retrieve User Counts Grouped by Non-Existent Key\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /users/count/groupBy/key\n   - **Description:** Request user counts grouped by a key that does not exist or is invalid (e.g., \u201cnonExistentKey\u201d) to test error handling and response correctness for invalid grouping keys.\n   - **Expected Response:** A 400 Bad Request or 404 Not Found error response indicating the key parameter is invalid or unsupported. No counts should be returned.\n\n3. **Title:** Cross-Verify Counts by Different Keys for Consistency\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /users/count/groupBy/key\n   - **Description:** Make two requests sequentially, grouping first by \u201ccountry\u201d and then by \u201cregion\u201d (or another hierarchical key). Compare the sums of user counts from these two groupings to check for consistency and identify potential discrepancies in aggregation logic.\n   - **Expected Response:** Both responses should be 200 OK, each containing valid grouped counts. The sum of user counts in both results should match the total number of users, confirming no users were omitted or double-counted.\n\n4. **Title:** Simulate Concurrent Requests with Different Keys\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /users/count/groupBy/key\n   - **Description:** Send multiple simultaneous requests grouped by varied keys (e.g., \u201ccountry\u201d, \u201cuserType\u201d, \u201cstatus\u201d) to test concurrency handling and consistent response generation under load.\n   - **Expected Response:** All requests should complete with 200 OK and correct grouping counts, with no data races or inconsistent states observed. Responses should be returned within acceptable time frames.\n\n5. **Title:** Verify Idempotency and State Consistency after Repeated Requests\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /users/count/groupBy/key\n   - **Description:** Repeatedly invoke the grouping endpoint with the same key parameter multiple times over a short period to verify that results remain consistent and that no side effects or state changes occur due to repeated querying.\n   - **Expected Response:** All responses should be identical and 200 OK, demonstrating that the system\u2019s counting and grouping are stable and do not mutate internal state during retrieval.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis test scenario thoroughly exercises the GET /users/count/groupBy/key endpoint by verifying correct grouping by valid keys, error handling for invalid keys, consistency across hierarchical keys, concurrency robustness, and idempotent behavior. The scenario\u2019s multi-step interactions are designed to detect aggregation mismatches, improper error management, concurrency-related faults, and hidden state mutations in user grouping counts.", "usage": {"total_tokens": 56234, "total_cost": 0.026063600000000003}, "unique_endpoints": {"200": [], "300": [], "400": ["GET /users/count"], "500": 0}, "total_true_result": 0, "total_false_result": 2}
