This request will contain valid, correctly formatted boundary definitions designed to overlap partially. Validate that the returned grouped counts correspond accurately to the spatial coverage of each boundary type without double counting overlapping areas. Verify that the counts are consistent and match expected aggregations based on known test data.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with a JSON response containing separated count groups for each boundary type (bbox, bcircle, bpoly). Each group should contain user counts that are plausible and correctly aggregated for the spatial areas defined. No user should be counted more than once if boundaries overlap unless explicitly expected. Response schema should be valid and complete.\n\n2. **Title:** Repeated Request Consistency and Caching Behavior Verification\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /users/count/groupBy/boundary\n   - **Description:** Repeat the exact request from step 1 to verify idempotency and consistency in the API's response. The system should return the same counts for grouped users without inconsistencies or state leakage. This step also examines caching or rate-limiting side effects.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with JSON having the same grouped counts as the previous request. Identical results indicate stable and consistent aggregation and caching behavior.\n\n3. **Title:** Malformed and Incomplete Boundary Input Handling\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /users/count/groupBy/boundary\n   - **Description:** Send a request containing invalid geometries such as a polygon with self-intersecting boundaries, a circle definition missing the radius, and a badly formatted bounding box with swapped coordinates. This tests the API\u2019s robust input validation and its error reporting for malformed spatial boundaries.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 400 Bad Request with clear error messages indicating which boundary inputs are invalid and why. No partial success responses or ambiguous errors should be returned. The API must reject the entire request and provide guidance to correct the input format.\n\n4. **Title:** Boundary Type Exhaustive Expansion and Dependency Testing Across Requests\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /users/count/groupBy/boundary\n   - **Description:** Send multiple sequential requests with varying increments in the complexity and number of boundaries: start with a single bounding box, then add multiple circles, then polygons of increasing vertex counts. After each request, verify that cumulative counts logically increase or remain stable with no data loss or erratic fluctuations. This tests dependency handling and internal state consistency in multi-boundary data aggregations.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with logically consistent JSON aggregated counts. Counts should reflect expected increases or steady-state behavior when boundaries expand or overlap and should never drop unexpectedly.\n\n5. **Title:** Stress Test with Large Volume and Complexity of Boundary Input Data\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /users/count/groupBy/boundary\n   - **Description:** Construct a single request containing an extensive list (e.g., 50+) of mixed boundary types (bounding boxes, circles, polygons) with large spatial coverage overlaps and measure API response time and integrity. This tests performance limits, potential timeouts, memory leaks, and correctness under load.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with correctly structured grouped counts for all boundaries without timeouts, server errors, or truncated data. Response time should be within acceptable thresholds (defined by SLA). No error codes such as 500 or partial data failures should occur.\n\n6. **Title:** Invalid Content-Type and Method Handling\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /users/count/groupBy/boundary (also test GET and PUT methods)\n   - **Description:** Attempt to call the POST /users/count/groupBy/boundary using unsupported HTTP methods such as GET and PUT, and send requests with incorrect content-types (e.g., text/plain). Validate that method restrictions and content-type validations are correctly enforced by the server.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed for disallowed methods, and HTTP 415 Unsupported Media Type for unsupported content types with appropriate error messages. The API should prevent processing non-compliant requests robustly.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis detailed scenario sequence tests the POST /users/count/groupBy/boundary endpoint with complex multi-boundary aggregations, consistency checks, invalid input validation, incremental complexity handling, stress/load scenarios, and protocol adherence verifications. This helps uncover issues related to spatial data aggregation correctness, internal state and caching consistency, performance under large data volumes, thorough input validation, and HTTP protocol robustness.", "usage": {"total_tokens": 73073, "total_cost": 0.03349760000000001}, "unique_endpoints": {"200": [], "300": [], "400": ["POST /users/count"], "500": 0}, "total_true_result": 0, "total_false_result": 1}
