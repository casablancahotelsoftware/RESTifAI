The boundaries partially overlap each other, and include one polygon fully inside another. Tags include valid existing tags, non-existent tags, and mixed-case variations to test tag normalization and filtering.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with a JSON response detailing perimeter densities grouped by each boundary polygon and further grouped by each tag. The response should correctly show non-zero perimeter densities for polygons with valid data, zero or empty results for non-existent tags without errors, and consistent handling of overlapping boundaries without double counting shared segments.\n\n2. **Title:** Validate Consistency by Re-querying with Modified Boundaries\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/perimeter/density/groupBy/boundary/groupBy/tag\n   - **Description:** Send a follow-up request with a slightly modified set of boundaries that removes one polygon and adjusts another polygon\u2019s vertices to no longer overlap with the removed polygon. Use the same tags as before.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with updated perimeter densities grouped accordingly. The response should reflect the removal of the polygon by no longer including its group results and show accurate density redistribution due to boundary modifications. Perimeter values should not inflate or deflate unexpectedly compared to the prior step.\n\n3. **Title:** Test Input Validation on Malformed Polygon Boundary Input\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/perimeter/density/groupBy/boundary/groupBy/tag\n   - **Description:** Submit a malformed polygon boundary (e.g., self-intersecting polygon, missing closing coordinates, or wrongly ordered vertices) with valid tags.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 400 Bad Request with descriptive error message indicating invalid polygon geometry that prevents processing. The system should not process this request or return partial results.\n\n4. **Title:** Test Edge Case with Empty Tag List and Empty Boundary List\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/perimeter/density/groupBy/boundary/groupBy/tag\n   - **Description:** Send a request with an empty array of boundaries and an empty array of tags.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with an empty result set, i.e., no groups returned. The server should gracefully handle the empty input without errors or unexpected behaviors.\n\n5. **Title:** High-Load Concurrency Test with Identical Requests\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/perimeter/density/groupBy/boundary/groupBy/tag\n   - **Description:** Simultaneously send 10 identical valid requests using rich datasets including multiple boundaries and tags to simulate load. Check responses for consistency across concurrent executions.\n   - **Expected Response:** All 10 requests should return HTTP 200 OK with identical result data sets showing consistent perimeter densities grouped by boundary and tag. No race conditions, partial responses, or data mismatches should occur.\n\n6. **Title:** Cross-Validation of Grouping Results Against Simplified Single-Tag Queries\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/perimeter/density/groupBy/boundary/groupBy/tag\n   - **Description:** For a selected boundary polygon from prior tests, send multiple smaller requests each grouping by only a single tag (from the multi-tag set used previously). Compare sum of perimeter densities of these single-tag responses against the corresponding boundary\u2019s total perimeter density grouped by all tags.\n   - **Expected Response:** The sum of the perimeter density values for individual tags should logically not exceed and closely match the total perimeter density returned when grouping by all tags. Discrepancies or overlaps could indicate aggregation errors or counting defects.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis scenario rigorously tests the POST /elements/perimeter/density/groupBy/boundary/groupBy/tag endpoint through a comprehensive set of interactions including overlapping and adjusted boundary polygons, complex tag variations, input validation for malformed polygons, handling of empty input cases, concurrency load stability, and detailed validation of aggregation consistency across multi-tag and single-tag group queries. It thoroughly evaluates data correctness, system robustness, error response handling, state management, and concurrency behavior to uncover subtle bugs related to spatial grouping, aggregation logic, and input sanitation.", "usage": {"total_tokens": 35873, "total_cost": 0.018332}, "unique_endpoints": {"200": [], "300": [], "400": [], "500": 0}, "total_true_result": 0, "total_false_result": 0}
