The test verifies that the API correctly calculates the density of OSM contributions (number of contributions divided by the total area in square kilometers) and maintains consistency in repeated and incremental calls. It also tests boundary cases such as extremely small or large areas, and invalid polygon definitions to check validation handling. The scenario concludes by comparing results from overlapping zones to detect any unexpected inconsistency or state dependency across calls.  \n   - **Expected Response:**  \n     For valid polygons, a 200 OK response with a numeric density value that logically corresponds to the input area and contribution count. For invalid input polygons or missing parameters, a clear 4xx Bad Request error with descriptive messages. Consistent results for repeated identical requests, and expected variations for different areas reflecting accurate density calculations without dependency side effects.  \n\n2. **Title:** Stepwise Test Process for Density Calculation, Recalculation, and Error Handling  \n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /contributions/count/density  \n   - **Step 1:** Submit a valid polygon representing a medium-sized urban area  \n     - **Description:** Send a well-formed polygon to retrieve the contributions density for a known city area.  \n     - **Expected Response:** 200 OK with a floating-point density number greater than zero, reflecting realistic contribution density.  \n   - **Step 2:** Immediately resend the same polygon request to verify idempotence and caching effects  \n     - **Description:** Confirm that repeated calls with the same input produce identical density values and no errors.  \n     - **Expected Response:** 200 OK with the exact same density number as Step 1.  \n   - **Step 3:** Send a polygon of an extremely small area (e.g., a few square meters)  \n     - **Description:** Tests the API\u2019s handling of very small areas potentially leading to high density or divide-by-zero risk.  \n     - **Expected Response:** Either a valid density result consistent with contributions count or a clear 4xx error if the area is below an acceptable threshold.  \n   - **Step 4:** Send a polygon with invalid geometry (self-intersecting polygon)  \n     - **Description:** Tests validation logic for malformed spatial inputs.  \n     - **Expected Response:** 400 Bad Request with an error message indicating invalid polygon geometry.  \n   - **Step 5:** Submit overlapping polygons that partially intersect to check if density results are independently calculated  \n     - **Description:** Send two polygons overlapping in area to observe if each response remains consistent without state interference.  \n     - **Expected Response:** Two separate 200 OK responses with densities reflecting the respective areas independently, without leakage or mismatched contribution counts.  \n   - **Step 6:** Send a very large polygon covering multiple regions  \n     - **Description:** Test performance and aggregation logic correctness over large spatial scales.  \n     - **Expected Response:** 200 OK with a realistic density number representative for the large area, no timeouts or errors.  \n   - **Step 7:** Send a request missing the polygon parameter or with an empty area  \n     - **Description:** Validate API\u2019s required parameter enforcement and error handling.  \n     - **Expected Response:** 400 Bad Request with a clear error message about missing or invalid input parameters.  \n\n**Summary:**  \nThis test scenario rigorously exercises the POST /contributions/count/density endpoint by submitting sequential and varied polygon spatial inputs to validate correct density calculation, response consistency, error handling, and independence of state between multiple calls. It focuses on discovering flaws in input validation, numeric stability, caching or state management bugs, and logical correctness across a range of typical and edge cases.", "usage": {"total_tokens": 30811, "total_cost": 0.0151792}, "unique_endpoints": {"200": [], "300": [], "400": ["POST /contributions/count"], "500": 0}, "total_true_result": 0, "total_false_result": 0}
