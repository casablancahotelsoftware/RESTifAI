First, request perimeter data grouped by multiple bboxes. Next, call with a bcircle boundary set centered on overlapping coordinates with previous bboxes. Third, query with bpoly boundaries outlining polygons partially overlapping prior boundaries. Finally, send requests combining boundary types (e.g., bbox + bcircle or bbox + bpoly) in one request to verify input validation and API\u2019s handling of mixed boundaries. Repeat some calls to test idempotency and data consistency.  \n    - **Expected Responses:**  \n      For pure single-type boundary requests (bbox, bcircle, or bpoly), expect HTTP 200 OK with boundary-grouped perimeter data accurately reflecting the spatial extents and showing consistent values upon repetition. For requests mixing multiple boundary types in a single call, expect HTTP 400 Bad Request or clear error messages indicating unsupported combination of boundary parameters. Repeated calls with the same parameters should return consistent results, confirming idempotent behavior and consistent data aggregation.\n\n2. **Title:** Cross-Validation of Perimeter Data Consistency Across Overlapping Boundaries  \n    - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/perimeter/groupBy/boundary  \n    - **Description:**  \n      Send GET requests grouped by adjoining or overlapping boundaries of the same type (e.g., two adjacent bboxes each slightly overlapping the other). Compare the aggregate perimeter values returned for each boundary and verify if the overlapping region perimeters are appropriately accounted for without double counting or omission. Then query a superset boundary encompassing both previous boundaries and cross-check whether the summed perimeter from the individual boundaries reasonably aligns with the larger area\u2019s perimeter, allowing for spatial overlap considerations.  \n    - **Expected Responses:**  \n      The API should return consistent perimeter aggregates for each individual boundary. The sum of perimeters from overlapping boundaries should reflect logical aggregation\u2014neither inflated by double counting nor erroneously lower due to omission. The perimeter for the superset boundary should be coherent in relation to the individual boundaries\u2019 sums, highlighting correct spatial aggregation logic and preventing data inconsistencies.\n\n3. **Title:** Resilience Check with Malformed or Missing Boundary Parameters  \n    - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/perimeter/groupBy/boundary  \n    - **Description:**  \n      Submit requests with boundary parameters that are malformed (e.g., invalid coordinate syntax in bbox, malformed circle radius, invalid polygon vertices order) and requests with missing mandatory boundary parameters. Observe how the API processes these inputs and whether it handles errors gracefully without crashing or returning ambiguous responses. Include attempts with empty or null boundary arrays to test robustness.  \n    - **Expected Responses:**  \n      The API should return HTTP 400 Bad Request with clear, informative error messages explaining the nature of the malformed inputs or missing required parameters. The system should not throw unhandled exceptions or HTTP 500 errors. This confirms robust validation and clear client feedback for incorrect requests.\n\n4. **Title:** Concurrency and Idempotency Validation on Boundary Grouping Requests  \n    - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/perimeter/groupBy/boundary  \n    - **Description:**  \n      Simultaneously send multiple identical requests for perimeter data grouped by a predefined set of boundaries (choose one boundary type, such as bcircles) to simulate concurrent client access. Also, re-issue requests sequentially with identical parameters to verify idempotency. Verify that concurrent requests return consistent results, are isolated in processing, and do not interfere or cause race conditions in the response data.  \n    - **Expected Responses:**  \n      Each concurrent request should return the same accurate perimeter grouping data without errors or inconsistent results. Sequential duplicate requests should return consistent results as well, illustrating correct stateless request handling and isolation. No concurrency-related issues such as partial data, corrupted aggregates, or inconsistent timing responses should occur.\n\nSummary:  \nThis scenario rigorously tests the GET /elements/perimeter/groupBy/boundary endpoint\u2019s ability to correctly handle valid grouping boundaries of various types, reject unsupported mixed-type boundary requests, maintain data consistency across overlapping spatial boundaries, gracefully manage malformed or missing parameters, and operate reliably under concurrent and repeated access. It targets uncovering defects in input validation, spatial aggregation logic, concurrency handling, and idempotency, ensuring the API delivers robust and consistent spatial perimeter data in real-world, complex usage patterns.", "usage": {"total_tokens": 261347, "total_cost": 0.11225840000000001}, "unique_endpoints": {"200": [], "300": [], "400": ["GET /elements/perimeter"], "500": 1}, "total_true_result": 1, "total_false_result": 6}
