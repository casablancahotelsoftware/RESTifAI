The request payload will include a valid complex polygon boundary to get aggregated perimeter information by element type.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with a JSON body containing a list of element types, each with its corresponding aggregated perimeter value. The perimeter values should be positive numbers consistent with the given polygon boundary area.\n\n2. **Title:** Submit Perimeter Request with Boundary Expansion and Validate Data Consistency\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/perimeter/groupBy/type\n   - **Description:** Repeat the perimeter grouping request with an expanded polygon boundary that partially overlaps and partially extends beyond the previous polygon. This is to verify that perimeter calculations adjust correctly to the new extended boundary and that element types reported include expected new types or updated perimeter totals.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with updated perimeter values. The total perimeter for element types within the extended area should be equal or greater than the initial request where overlaps exist. No element types present in the original polygon should be missing unless fully excluded by the new polygon.\n\n3. **Title:** Submit Perimeter Request Using an Invalid Polygon Format\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/perimeter/groupBy/type\n   - **Description:** Send a perimeter grouping request with a deliberately malformed polygon boundary (e.g., unclosed polygon line or invalid coordinate pairs) to test the API\u2019s input validation robustness and error reporting accuracy.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 400 Bad Request with an informative error message indicating invalid polygon boundary input, specifying the reason for rejection (e.g., unclosed polygon). The system should not process the perimeter calculation for invalid geometry.\n\n4. **Title:** Submit Perimeter Request with Empty or Null Polygon Boundary\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/perimeter/groupBy/type\n   - **Description:** Send a request with an empty polygon boundary or a null/undefined polygon parameter to test how the API handles missing or empty spatial filter inputs.\n   - **Expected Response:** Preferably HTTP 400 Bad Request indicating the polygon boundary is missing or invalid. If the API defaults to a global boundary in absence of input, it should clearly document this and return consistent perimeter values for all elements grouped by type within the default scope.\n\n5. **Title:** Concurrent Perimeter Grouping Requests with Varying Polygon Boundaries\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/perimeter/groupBy/type\n   - **Description:** Simultaneously submit multiple perimeter grouping requests with different polygon boundaries (some overlapping, some distinct) to test concurrency control, data consistency, and system stability under load.\n   - **Expected Response:** Each concurrent request should complete successfully with HTTP 200 OK, returning consistent and accurate perimeter results respective to each unique polygon boundary. No cross-request data leakage or race conditions should occur, and server performance should remain stable.\n\n6. **Title:** Verify Idempotency of Perimeter Grouping with Repeated Identical Requests\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/perimeter/groupBy/type\n   - **Description:** Send the exact same request payload for perimeter grouping multiple times in succession to verify the API\u2019s idempotency and data consistency across repeated identical queries.\n   - **Expected Response:** Each request should return identical perimeter grouping results (same element types and matching perimeter sums) with HTTP 200 OK, ensuring repeatable and stable behavior without side effects or data mutations.\n\n7. **Title:** Cross-check Perimeter Totals with Known Element Type Data\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/perimeter/groupBy/type (Multiple Calls)\n   - **Description:** Use known static test datasets or previously validated boundaries to submit perimeter grouping requests, then cross-check the returned perimeter sums for individual element types against expected benchmark values.\n   - **Expected Response:** Perimeter totals for each element type should exactly or closely match the known benchmarks within acceptable error margins. Significant deviation may indicate calculation errors or data inconsistencies.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis interaction sequence thoroughly exercises the POST /elements/perimeter/groupBy/type API\u2019s handling of complex polygon inputs, boundary changes, invalid inputs, concurrency, and idempotency. It is designed to detect issues such as inconsistent perimeter calculations under boundary expansions, inadequate input validation, concurrency or race condition bugs affecting response correctness, and improper handling of empty or malformed requests, ultimately ensuring robust and reliable perimeter grouping functionality by element type.", "usage": {"total_tokens": 69181, "total_cost": 0.031512399999999996}, "unique_endpoints": {"200": ["POST /elements/perimeter"], "300": [], "400": [], "500": 0}, "total_true_result": 0, "total_false_result": 1}
