The response should include valid boundary identifiers and their associated perimeter ratio values.\n\n2. **Title:** Trigger Boundary Data Change Simulation and Re-Query\n    - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/perimeter/ratio/groupBy/boundary\n    - **Description:** After simulating an external update in the underlying boundary data (e.g., addition, removal, or modification of one or more boundaries or OSM elements within boundaries), perform the same API call again to verify if perimeter ratio results reflect updated geometry and data changes.\n    - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with updated perimeter ratio values that differ appropriately from the initial response where expected (i.e., changed boundaries show consistent ratio adjustments), ensuring data freshness and state management.\n\n3. **Title:** Query with Complex Nested or Overlapping Boundaries to Detect Aggregation Defects\n    - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/perimeter/ratio/groupBy/boundary\n    - **Description:** Execute calls that include boundary parameters representing complex nested polygons or overlapping boundaries, either by boundary IDs or specific query filter parameters (if supported), to test for proper ratio grouping and aggregation, and to determine if the API handles these correctly without double counting or omission.\n    - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with perimeter ratio data for each boundary, reflecting accurate aggregation without duplication or misallocation. Responses should logically correspond to expected spatial relationships (e.g., nested boundaries' ratios do not sum inconsistently).\n\n4. **Title:** Call API with Unsupported or Malformed Boundary Identifiers to Test Validation\n    - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/perimeter/ratio/groupBy/boundary\n    - **Description:** Submit requests with unsupported boundary types, invalid IDs, or malformed boundary identifiers to evaluate the system's input validation and error handling mechanics.\n    - **Expected Response:** Graceful HTTP 400 Bad Request or HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity with clear, descriptive error messages explaining which boundary parameters are invalid and why, ensuring robustness against malformed inputs.\n\n5. **Title:** Verify Consistency and Idempotency through Repeated Calls without Data Changes\n    - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/perimeter/ratio/groupBy/boundary (called multiple times in quick succession)\n    - **Description:** Repeatedly invoke the API multiple times in rapid succession using the same boundary parameters to ascertain idempotency and stability under repeated load and to confirm no unexpected side effects or caching issues alter the perimeter ratio data inappropriately.\n    - **Expected Response:** Consistent HTTP 200 OK responses with identical or near-identical data in each response, confirming stable and idempotent behavior.\n\n6. **Title:** Concurrency Stress Test Involving Simultaneous Boundary Queries\n    - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/perimeter/ratio/groupBy/boundary\n    - **Description:** Simulate multiple concurrent clients sending boundary ratio group queries simultaneously with varying boundary inputs, including some overlapping and some disjoint boundaries, to test concurrency safety, response time variability, and potential race conditions.\n    - **Expected Response:** All requests return HTTP 200 OK with valid perimeter ratio data grouped correctly. No server errors (e.g., 500-series) or data inconsistencies should be observed. Response times remain within acceptable limits, and no deadlocks or timeouts occur.\n\n7. **Title:** Final Retrieval and Cross Verification with Other Aggregate Metrics (Manual Step)\n    - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/perimeter/ratio/groupBy/boundary\n    - **Description:** Retrieve the perimeter ratio data one final time and manually cross-verify data consistency against known boundary geometries, sizes, or other aggregated metrics (if possible) to detect subtle data mismatches or aggregation flaws not trivially caught by prior steps.\n    - **Expected Response:** Final confirmation that all perimeter ratio data aligns with expected spatial data. No anomalies or contradictory values appear as a result of the end-to-end interaction sequence.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThis detailed test scenario sequence uses the sole GET /elements/perimeter/ratio/groupBy/boundary endpoint in varied ways to mimic realistic data lifecycle events (initial retrieval, data updates), rigorously probe input validation, stress concurrency handling, and confirm idempotency and aggregation correctness against complex boundary scenarios. This interaction chain aims to uncover potential bugs related to stale caches, incorrect spatial aggregation in nested or overlapping boundaries, error handling gaps, concurrency race flaws, and inconsistent data state management across repeated calls.", "usage": {"total_tokens": 45513, "total_cost": 0.022614000000000002}, "unique_endpoints": {"200": [], "300": [], "400": ["GET /elements/perimeter"], "500": 0}, "total_true_result": 1, "total_false_result": 1}
