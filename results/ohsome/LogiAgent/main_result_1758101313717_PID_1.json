This will verify the endpoint's ability to successfully perform grouping and counting when given proper inputs.\n    - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with a JSON body containing counts of elements grouped by the requested key, showing multiple key values each with associated counts. The response schema should confirm the presence of grouping keys and numeric count fields.\n\n2. **Title:** Count OSM Elements Grouped by Multiple Keys Sequentially to Check Data Consistency\n    - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/count/groupBy/key\n    - **Description:** Send multiple sequential requests changing the grouping key parameter to different valid keys (e.g., key=building, then key=landuse). Each response is expected to be consistent with the previous data state, with logically separate counts relevant to each grouping key.\n    - **Expected Response:** Each request returns HTTP 200 OK with accurate counts grouped by the requested key. The counts should correspond to the known distribution of OSM elements for each key without overlap or mismatch.\n\n3. **Title:** Verify Response to Invalid or Empty Grouping Key Parameter\n    - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/count/groupBy/key\n    - **Description:** Test robustness by making requests where the grouping key parameter is either missing, empty, or contains invalid characters (e.g., key=\"\", key=\"@@@\", key with a very long string). This is to check the server\u2019s parameter validation and error handling for invalid inputs.\n    - **Expected Response:** HTTP 400 Bad Request with a clear error message specifying the invalid or missing parameter. The response should not be a server error or ambiguous failure, and no counts should be returned.\n\n4. **Title:** Stress Test with Rapid Consecutive Requests Using Different Grouping Keys to Detect Race Conditions\n    - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/count/groupBy/key\n    - **Description:** Fire a rapid sequence of concurrent GET requests, each specifying different grouping keys in quick succession or parallel (e.g., keys: highway, landuse, amenity, waterway). This checks the API\u2019s thread safety, concurrency handling, and internal state management to ensure no race condition or data leakage occurs between responses.\n    - **Expected Response:** All requests should complete with HTTP 200 OK, each returning accurate counts for its respective grouping key independently. No cross-contamination of counts or inconsistent groupings should occur.\n\n5. **Title:** Edge Case Query with Non-Existent or Rare Grouping Keys to Test Empty Result Handling\n    - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/count/groupBy/key\n    - **Description:** Query using rare or unlikely grouping keys (e.g., key=nonexistentkey12345) which are expected to not match any elements. This tests whether the API correctly returns empty counts without errors or inconsistent data.\n    - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with an empty grouping result or zero counts for all groups. The response should clearly indicate the lack of matched elements without generating errors.\n\n6. **Title:** Verify Idempotency and Caching Behavior by Repeating Identical Requests\n    - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/count/groupBy/key\n    - **Description:** Repeat identical GET requests with the same grouping key multiple times (e.g., key=highway) to observe if responses remain consistent, and to detect possible caching effects or state inconsistencies.\n    - **Expected Response:** All identical requests return the same HTTP 200 OK response with unchanged counts. No differences in data or errors should arise between subsequent calls.\n\n7. **Title:** Test API Behavior with Unsupported HTTP Methods and Unexpected Headers\n    - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/count/groupBy/key\n    - **Description:** Attempt the same endpoint with unsupported methods like POST, PUT, DELETE and with unexpected headers (e.g., Content-Type: application/json in a GET request) to verify proper method enforcement and header validation.\n    - **Expected Response:** Supported method (GET) returns 200 as usual. Unsupported methods should return HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed or HTTP 400 Bad Request with clear error messages. Invalid headers in GET requests should either be ignored or return correct error messages without affecting endpoint stability.\n\nSummary:  \nThis end-to-end scenario tests the GET /elements/count/groupBy/key endpoint extensively, including validations for correct grouping under various key inputs, robustness against invalid or unexpected parameters, concurrency and caching behaviors, and response consistency. By mixing valid, invalid, edge case, and malformed queries along with concurrency and method tests, it helps expose potential bugs related to input validation, data consistency, state management, concurrency safety, and error handling unsupported HTTP methods or headers.", "usage": {"total_tokens": 137799, "total_cost": 0.060495600000000004}, "unique_endpoints": {"200": [], "300": [], "400": ["GET /elements/count"], "500": 0}, "total_true_result": 0, "total_false_result": 4}
