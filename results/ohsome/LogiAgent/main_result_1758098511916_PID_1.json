{"all_cnt": 0, "all_request_sequence": [], "right_results": [], "wrong_results": [], "test_scenario_response_message": "1. **Title:** Initial Density Query with Valid Polygon Boundaries\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/perimeter/density/groupBy/boundary\n   - **Description:** Submit a request with multiple polygon boundaries (bpolys) defining distinct geographic areas. The request should include a valid spatial filter specifying these polygons to group the density of OSM elements by these boundaries.\n   - **Expected Response:** Status 200 OK with a structured JSON showing density values for each polygon boundary. The response should consistently reflect the areas defined, and no overlapping or duplicated entries should exist.\n\n2. **Title:** Repeat Density Query with Identical Boundaries to Test Response Consistency and Caching\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/perimeter/density/groupBy/boundary\n   - **Description:** Repeat the same request as step 1 exactly, to verify if the API returns consistent density data across repeated calls with identical input. This also tests potential caching mechanisms and their correctness.\n   - **Expected Response:** Status 200 OK with results identical to the first request without data drift. Density numbers and group structure must be consistent and stable.\n\n3. **Title:** Density Query Using Overlapping Mixed Boundary Types (Bcircles and Bpolys)\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/perimeter/density/groupBy/boundary\n   - **Description:** Send a request that contains mixed boundary filters combining overlapping bcircles and bpolys, where certain spatial regions overlap. The goal is to evaluate if overlapping boundaries lead to correct separate groupings without data leakage or incorrect aggregation.\n   - **Expected Response:** Status 200 OK showing grouped density data distinctly mapped to each boundary. Overlapping areas should be properly attributed to each group boundary without double-counting or missing data.\n\n4. **Title:** Density Query with Malformed Boundary Input to Test Input Validation\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/perimeter/density/groupBy/boundary\n   - **Description:** Provide a request where one or more boundary definitions are malformed (e.g., invalid polygon coordinates, improper JSON formatting, or missing required fields). This tests the API\u2019s input validation and error reporting.\n   - **Expected Response:** Status 400 Bad Request or another suitable error (e.g., 422 Unprocessable Entity) with a clear error message describing the boundary validation failure. No partial success responses should be returned.\n\n5. **Title:** Density Query with Partially Overlapping Boundaries and Updates in Underlying Data\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /elements/perimeter/density/groupBy/boundary (twice)\n   - **Description:** First, perform a density groupBy boundary query with partially overlapping boundaries. Then, simulate or wait for an update in the underlying OSM data (e.g., new elements added/removed in one boundary area). Re-run the same request to verify that the density results reflect the updated data and that boundaries still report correct and consistent values considering the overlap.\n   - **Expected Response:** \n     - First call: Status 200 OK with correct densities per boundary.\n     - Second call after data update: Status 200 OK with density values reflecting the changes, showing expected variation aligned with data updates. The grouping must properly handle the overlaps and correctly report incremental changes without cross-boundary contamination.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis detailed test scenario exercises the POST /elements/perimeter/density/groupBy/boundary API focusing on boundary spatial filtering with polygons and circles, ensuring correctness in response data consistency, handling of overlapping boundaries, robust validation of input formats, and responsiveness to underlying data changes. The scenario uncovers potential defects in input validation, group aggregation, state management, and data consistency across repeated and updated queries.", "usage": {"total_tokens": 31348, "total_cost": 0.0155404}, "unique_endpoints": {"200": [], "300": [], "400": [], "500": 0}, "total_true_result": 0, "total_false_result": 0}
