This baseline will establish the overall distribution of element densities categorized by type across all available data.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with a well-structured JSON object listing element types and their corresponding densities. The data should be logically consistent, with no missing type entries and total density values greater than zero.\n\n2. **Title:** Apply Geographic Boundary Filter Sampled by Type Density\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/count/density/groupBy/type\n   - **Description:** Perform a request with a specific geographic boundary parameter (e.g., a polygon or bounding box of a city region) to retrieve element densities grouped by type constrained within this region.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with density figures for elements categorized by type strictly within the provided boundary. The density values should be lower or equal to the baseline densities from step 1. The response should exclude types with zero count in the specified boundary, maintaining consistent grouping keys.\n\n3. **Title:** Cross-Verify Density Consistency on Repeated Boundary Queries Under Concurrent Requests\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/count/density/groupBy/type (invoked multiple times)\n   - **Description:** Submit several concurrent identical requests using the same geographic boundary filter as step 2. This tests data consistency and thread safety in handling repeated workload with the same parameters.\n   - **Expected Response:** Each concurrent request should return identical density data matching step 2\u2019s response without variation or partial data. No 5xx errors or timeouts should occur.\n\n4. **Title:** Negative Test - Incorrect Boundary Format and Parameter Validation\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/count/density/groupBy/type\n   - **Description:** Submit a request with a malformed or invalid geographic boundary parameter (e.g., invalid geometry string or unsupported coordinate format) to assess input validation and error handling capabilities.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 400 Bad Request with an error message clearly indicating invalid boundary input. The server should not crash or return ambiguous errors. No partial or empty density data should be returned.\n\n5. **Title:** Edge Case Test - Query with Boundary Having No Elements\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/count/density/groupBy/type\n   - **Description:** Submit a request using a geographic boundary known to contain no OSM elements (e.g., a remote or oceanic area) and validate behavior when result sets are empty.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with an empty or zero-density dataset corresponding to the boundary query. The API should gracefully handle the edge case without returning errors or invalid data fields.\n\n6. **Title:** Verify Impact of Changing Boundary Types on Grouped Density Results\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/count/density/groupBy/type\n   - **Description:** Sequentially query the endpoint using different boundary shapes or sizes (circle, polygon, rectangle) for the same geographic location. This tests whether boundary type parameter variations affect the grouping and density calculations correctly and consistently.\n   - **Expected Response:** Each call returns densities consistent with the effective area of the boundary. Smaller or more precisely defined boundaries should not inflate results, and overall data aggregation should be logically sound and coherent with spatial filtering expectations.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis test scenario sequence extensively evaluates the GET /elements/count/density/groupBy/type endpoint for proper grouping by type and spatial filtering. It inspects data consistency across unconstrained and boundary-limited queries, robustness under concurrent requests, proper input validation for malformed boundaries, accurate handling of empty spatial datasets, and the correctness of results when boundaries vary in geometry. The sequence targets subtle bugs in spatial aggregation logic, state management under load, and error handling to ensure reliable and consistent element density information delivery.", "usage": {"total_tokens": 55693, "total_cost": 0.025653999999999996}, "unique_endpoints": {"200": [], "300": [], "400": ["GET /elements/count"], "500": 0}, "total_true_result": 0, "total_false_result": 1}
