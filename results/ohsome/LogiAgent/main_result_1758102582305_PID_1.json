Use a valid bbox parameter representing a metropolitan area. Verify that the response returns a density count map matching the geographic boundary.\n    - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with a JSON payload containing a precise count density aggregation grouped accurately by the given bbox boundary. Values should correspond logically to the known contribution density in the area.\n\n2. **Title:** Re-query Using Different Boundary Types and Validate Data Consistency Across Groupings\n    - **API Endpoint:** GET /contributions/count/density/groupBy/boundary\n    - **Description:** Send a GET request using a circle (bcircle) boundary around the same general area as in step 1 but with a slightly smaller radius. Compare results to ensure density counts are appropriately lower or overlapping based on area size differences.\n    - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with contribution counts logically consistent with the smaller circular boundary, demonstrating correct aggregation. Density values must fall within or below the bbox results of step 1, with no contradicting data.\n\n3. **Title:** Attempt to Mix Boundary Types Simultaneously in a Single Request to Check Input Validation\n    - **API Endpoint:** GET /contributions/count/density/groupBy/boundary\n    - **Description:** Construct a GET request erroneously including parameters for both a polygon (bpoly) and a bbox simultaneously to test the system\u2019s input validation and error handling.\n    - **Expected Response:** HTTP 400 Bad Request with a clear and informative error message indicating mutually exclusive boundary parameters and rejecting the request due to invalid input.\n\n4. **Title:** Concurrent Requests with Overlapping Boundaries to Detect Race Conditions or State Issues\n    - **API Endpoint:** GET /contributions/count/density/groupBy/boundary (multiple simultaneous calls)\n    - **Description:** Send concurrent GET requests using overlapping polygon boundaries (bpoly) that intersect partially. Request density counts grouped by these overlapping boundaries concurrently to test how the server handles simultaneous aggregation calculations on intersecting spatial data.\n    - **Expected Response:** All requests return HTTP 200 OK with valid JSON responses. Densities reported for overlapping regions should be consistent with spatial intersections without data corruption, duplication, or race condition artifacts.\n\n5. **Title:** Test Response to Invalid or Malformed Boundary Parameters\n    - **API Endpoint:** GET /contributions/count/density/groupBy/boundary\n    - **Description:** Submit requests with malformed geometry formats (e.g., polygon with intersecting edges or invalid coordinate data) and invalid boundary parameters values such as a bbox with coordinates out of range or incorrect data types.\n    - **Expected Response:** HTTP 400 Bad Request with detailed validation error messages about the malformed geometry or invalid parameters. The system should gracefully reject these inputs without side effects.\n\n6. **Title:** Re-Verify Data Stability After Dynamic Changes to Boundaries\n    - **API Endpoint:** GET /contributions/count/density/groupBy/boundary\n    - **Description:** After completing above steps, make subsequent GET requests with slightly adjusted boundaries (e.g., shifted bbox or resized circles) to verify data freshness and system response to changing spatial queries.\n    - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with updated density results reflecting precise boundary changes. No stale or cached incorrect data should be returned. Density values should increase, decrease, or shift logically corresponding to boundary adjustments.\n\nSummary:  \nThis scenario thoroughly tests GET /contributions/count/density/groupBy/boundary through multiple realistic interaction paths including valid queries using varied boundary types, error handling on invalid or mixed parameters, concurrency handling in overlapping boundary cases, and dynamic boundary adjustments. It ensures data aggregation correctness, robust validation, concurrency safety, and appropriate error messaging, uncovering defects in input parsing, state management, spatial aggregation logic, and response consistency.", "usage": {"total_tokens": 76950, "total_cost": 0.03499560000000001}, "unique_endpoints": {"200": [], "300": [], "400": ["GET /contributions/count"], "500": 0}, "total_true_result": 0, "total_false_result": 2}
