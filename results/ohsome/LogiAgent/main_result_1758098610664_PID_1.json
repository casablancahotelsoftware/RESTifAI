This initial call will use valid, non-overlapping boundaries to check standard grouping and density calculations.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with a JSON payload containing density values mapped correctly to each provided boundary type. Response data should show consistent and plausible density values with no missing or duplicated groups.\n\n2. **Title:** Density Retrieval with Overlapping Boundaries\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/perimeter/density/groupBy/boundary\n   - **Description:** Repeat the density request but use spatially overlapping boundary inputs (e.g., overlapping polygons or circles) to verify whether density calculations handle overlaps correctly and independently, without data duplication or aggregation errors.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with density values for each boundary, accurately reflecting overlaps without double counting. Any overlaps are handled logically, and the groupings remain distinct.\n\n3. **Title:** Density Query with Invalid Boundary Inputs\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/perimeter/density/groupBy/boundary\n   - **Description:** Send requests with malformed or incomplete boundary parameters, such as incorrect coordinate formats, missing required boundary fields, or unsupported shapes, to test input validation and error management logic.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 400 Bad Request with clear error messages specifying invalid or missing boundary parameters. No partial data returned, and the system should not crash or return 500 errors.\n\n4. **Title:** Repeated Density Requests for Cache Consistency\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/perimeter/density/groupBy/boundary (repeated calls)\n   - **Description:** Perform several identical requests consecutively for the same set of boundaries to test server-side caching behavior, ensure consistent results, and verify no state leaks or unintended side effects across multiple calls.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK for all calls, with identical density results each time. No inconsistencies such as fluctuating values or stale data mismatches.\n\n5. **Title:** Rapid Sequential Calls with Mixed Valid and Invalid Boundaries\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/perimeter/density/groupBy/boundary\n   - **Description:** Rapidly perform multiple density queries mixing valid boundaries and some with subtle format errors or edge cases (e.g., near zero-area polygons), assessing robustness under load and input heterogeneity.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK for valid requests with correct density output, and HTTP 400 Bad Request for invalid ones with appropriate error details. The system remains stable with no crashes or degraded response times.\n\n6. **Title:** Density Request after External Data Mutation (Hypothetical Check)\n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/perimeter/density/groupBy/boundary\n   - **Description:** Trigger density retrieval, then modify underlying OSM data externally (simulated or via update process), and immediately query density again with the same boundaries to verify that changes in underlying data reflect accurately and timely in the groupBy calculations.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with density values updated appropriately to reflect modified data, confirming no caching or stale data issues. Differences between pre- and post-update density values are logically consistent with the data mutations.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis test scenario exercises the GET /elements/perimeter/density/groupBy/boundary endpoint through a sequence of requests involving valid, overlapping, malformed, and edge-case boundaries. It also examines server caching, error handling, and data freshness after changes. This comprehensive path is designed to detect data aggregation errors, input validation weaknesses, caching anomalies, state management flaws, and robustness under varied request conditions.", "usage": {"total_tokens": 57732, "total_cost": 0.026786400000000002}, "unique_endpoints": {"200": [], "300": [], "400": ["GET /elements/perimeter"], "500": 0}, "total_true_result": 0, "total_false_result": 1}
