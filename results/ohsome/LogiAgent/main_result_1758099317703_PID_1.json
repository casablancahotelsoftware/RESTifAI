Use valid spatial parameters representing overlapping and non-overlapping geographic areas. This step verifies the API's ability to handle complex mixed-boundary queries and correctly aggregate densities across different boundary geometries.  \n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with a response body containing density counts accurately grouped by each boundary type. The densities for overlapping spatial boundaries should reflect cumulative or distinct element counts as per specifications without data duplication or omissions.\n\n2. **Title:** Subsequent Request with Modified Boundaries to Check Data Consistency and Caching Behavior  \n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/count/density/groupBy/boundary  \n   - **Description:** Send another GET request using a slightly altered set of boundaries (e.g., shift the bbox coordinates slightly outward and change the radius of the bcircle) while keeping the same bpoly. This tests if the API recalculates densities correctly for modified spatial filters without returning cached or stale results from the previous call.  \n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with updated density values that accurately reflect the changes in spatial parameters, especially noticing increases or decreases where boundaries have grown or shrunk. No duplication or caching artifacts from previous results should appear.\n\n3. **Title:** Request with Overlapping Boundary Definitions to Detect Aggregation and Deduplication Flaws  \n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/count/density/groupBy/boundary  \n   - **Description:** Execute a request where multiple boundaries heavily overlap (e.g., overlapping bboxes and bcircles covering nearly the same geographic area). The goal is to check whether the system incorrectly double-counts elements falling within overlapping boundaries or incorrectly merges/group counts.  \n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with density counts that are logically consistent\u2014either showing separate counts per boundary with clear overlaps highlighted or properly deduplicated aggregates if the API design mandates. This helps reveal aggregation errors, counting bugs, or misinterpretations of boundary relationships.\n\n4. **Title:** Request with Malformed or Incomplete Boundary Input to Validate Input Handling and Error Reporting  \n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/count/density/groupBy/boundary  \n   - **Description:** Submit requests that include at least one boundary with invalid parameters (e.g., missing coordinates for bbox, negative radius for bcircle, or non-closed polygon for bpoly). This tests the robustness of input validation logic, error messaging, and partial response handling if multiple boundaries are sent.  \n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 400 Bad Request or a well-defined error response highlighting the specific boundary parameter issue(s). The API should neither crash nor silently ignore invalid inputs - errors must be descriptive and help debugging.\n\n5. **Title:** Concurrent Requests with Identical and Distinct Boundaries to Evaluate Concurrency and State Management  \n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/count/density/groupBy/boundary (multiple parallel calls)  \n   - **Description:** Simultaneously issue several GET requests\u2014some repeating the exact set of boundaries with identical parameters, others varying slightly between calls. This tests the API's ability to handle concurrency without race conditions, ensuring consistent and isolated results per request without cross-request data leakage or state corruption.  \n   - **Expected Response:** All requests should return HTTP 200 OK with densities consistent with their respective boundary inputs, contention or server errors should not occur. Response times should remain reasonable, reflecting safe concurrent processing.\n\n6. **Title:** Repeat Original Request After System Data Update to Validate Data Freshness and Consistency  \n   - **API Endpoint:** GET /elements/count/density/groupBy/boundary  \n   - **Description:** After simulating or scheduling an update to underlying OSM elements data (e.g., inserting or deleting OSM elements within the test boundaries by a backend process), re-run the original request from step 1 to verify that the endpoint returns updated density counts reflecting the data changes instead of stale or cached data.  \n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with density metrics updated appropriately to include increments or decrements in element counts matching the underlying data modifications. This step checks synchronization between data storage and aggregation queries.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis multi-step test scenario rigorously probes the GET /elements/count/density/groupBy/boundary endpoint\u2019s handling of mixed boundary types, spatial alterations, overlapping queries, malformed inputs, concurrency, and data freshness after updates. The scenario is designed to expose defects in aggregation logic, input validation, caching/state management, and server stability under realistic complex usage patterns typical for spatial data APIs.", "usage": {"total_tokens": 36157, "total_cost": 0.0179248}, "unique_endpoints": {"200": [], "300": [], "400": ["GET /elements/count"], "500": 0}, "total_true_result": 0, "total_false_result": 0}
