This step ensures the API correctly aggregates user counts by their type under nominal conditions.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with a JSON response listing user types along with their respective counts. The counts should be non-negative integers and reflect the current dataset's user distribution without filters.\n\n2. **Title:** Count Grouped by Type Using Specific and Edge Case Filters\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /users/count/groupBy/type\n   - **Description:** Submit counts grouped by type with filters targeting boundary polygon areas (e.g., a very small polygon or one with complex self-intersecting geometry) or unusual coordinate values. This tests the API\u2019s ability to handle spatial filtering accurately and robustly.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with counts of user types within the specified polygon. In cases where the polygon is invalid (e.g., self-intersecting), expect a well-defined error response such as HTTP 400 with an error message explaining the invalid boundary.\n\n3. **Title:** Validation of Input Errors by Sending Malformed or Missing Parameters\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /users/count/groupBy/type\n   - **Description:** Send requests with missing required parameters, malformed JSON bodies, or improper data types (e.g., sending a string instead of an object for filters). This step probes the API\u2019s input validation robustness.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 400 Bad Request with appropriate error messages indicating what parameters are missing or malformed. The API should not crash or return internal server errors.\n\n4. **Title:** Repeated Counts to Verify Idempotency and Data Consistency Over Time\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /users/count/groupBy/type\n   - **Description:** Perform multiple repeated calls with the exact same filters and payload over short intervals to validate that the count results remain consistent and stable, indicating that no unintended state changes or caching anomalies affect the responses.\n   - **Expected Response:** Multiple HTTP 200 OK responses with identical counts per user type across calls, indicating stable aggregation and no side effects or state mismanagement across calls.\n\n5. **Title:** Concurrent Calls to Count Users Grouped by Type to Detect Race Conditions or State Flaws\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /users/count/groupBy/type (called concurrently from different clients)\n   - **Description:** Simulate concurrent API invocations with identical and varying payloads to observe if concurrency causes inconsistent or corrupted responses, race conditions, or intermittent failures.\n   - **Expected Response:** All calls succeed with HTTP 200 OK and consistent, correct counts corresponding to their filters. No data corruption, deadlocks, or intermittent 5xx errors should surface.\n\n6. **Title:** Cross-Verification of Counts Across Different Filter Overlaps and Additive Regions\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /users/count/groupBy/type\n   - **Description:** Submit multiple requests where their polygon filters overlap partially and wholly, then verify that counts from the combined area equal or exceed counts from individual parts logically (e.g., count for union area \u2265 sum of disjoint areas, but \u2264 sum of overlapping queries). This tests aggregation logic and polygon spatial filtering accuracy.\n   - **Expected Response:** Logical consistency in counts\u2014values follow spatial aggregation rules. No anomalies such as counts decreasing when more area is included, or overlap counting causing inflated sums without justification.\n\n7. **Title:** Submission of Large Payloads with Many Types and Deeply Nested Filter Structures\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /users/count/groupBy/type\n   - **Description:** Send a large and complex request payload containing many filtering fields (e.g., nested or multiple boundary polygons, multiple type selectors if supported) to test payload size limits, processing capacity, and complexity handling.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 200 OK with accurate counts if the payload is valid, or HTTP 413 Payload Too Large or HTTP 400 Bad Request if limits are exceeded. The API should handle such cases gracefully without crashing.\n\n8. **Title:** Error Handling by Sending Unsupported or Unknown Types in the GroupBy Field\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /users/count/groupBy/type\n   - **Description:** Attempt to group counts by a non-existent or unsupported user type category to check how the API handles invalid grouping keys or filter parameters.\n   - **Expected Response:** HTTP 400 Bad Request or HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity with a clear error message about the unsupported grouping key. API should not crash or produce unexpected results.\n\n9. **Title:** Verify Data Consistency after Simulated Upstream Data Changes (via Polling)\n   - **API Endpoint:** POST /users/count/groupBy/type (Repeated over time)\n   - **Description:** Poll the API multiple times over a span where mock upstream user data changes could occur (simulate or prepare dataset changes if feasible), to confirm API correctly reflects updated user counts grouped by type.\n   - **Expected Response:** Counts should reflect the latest state of the data. Differences across calls should correspond logically to changes in user data. No stale caching should cause repeated identical results after expected data changes.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis extensive test scenario sequence explores POST /users/count/groupBy/type across a broad spectrum of realistic and boundary conditions involving spatial filters, input validation, concurrency, data consistency, and error handling. It aims to uncover subtle defects in aggregation logic, polygon filtering, concurrency robustness, and input processing that simpler tests might miss, ensuring a reliable, scalable, and robust user count grouping feature.", "usage": {"total_tokens": 55385, "total_cost": 0.026127200000000007}, "unique_endpoints": {"200": [], "300": [], "400": ["POST /users/count"], "500": 0}, "total_true_result": 0, "total_false_result": 1}
